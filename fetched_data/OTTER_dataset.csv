otter otters are amphibious (or in one case aquatic) carnivorous mammals
the otter subfamily lutrinae forms part of the family mustelidae which also includes weasels polecats badgers as well as others
with 13 species in 7 genera otters have an almost worldwide distribution
an otter's den is called a holt
male otters are dog otters females are bitches and babies are cubs or pups
the collective noun romp is sometimes used for a group of otters being descriptive of their often playful nature
otters have long slim bodies and relatively short limbs with webbed paws
most have sharp claws on their feet and all but the sea otter have long muscular tails
they have a very soft underfur which is protected by their outer layer of long guard hair
this traps a layer of air and keeps them dry and warm under water
otters do not depend on their specialized fur alone for survival in the cold waters where many live they also have very high metabolic rates
for example eurasian otters must eat 15% of their body weight a day and sea otters 20 to 25% depending on the temperature
in water as warm as 10°c an otter needs to catch 100 g of fish per hour to survive
most species hunt for 3 to 5 hours a day and nursing mothers up to 8 hours a day
most otters have fish as the primary item in their diet supplemented by frogs crayfish and crabs
some are expert at opening shellfish and others will take any available small mammals or birds
this prey dependence leaves otters very vulnerable to prey depletion
otters are very active chasing prey in the water or searching the beds of rivers lakes or the sea
most species live beside water entering it mainly to hunt or travel otherwise spending much of their time on land to avoid their fur becoming waterlogged
the sea otter lives actually in the sea
otters are playful animals for example sliding repeatedly down snowy slopes apparently from sheer enjoyment
different species vary in their social structure with some being largely solitary while others live in groups in a few species these groups may be fairly large
the following are short descriptions of a selection of species (see below for full list) the northern river otter (lontra canadensis) became one of the major animals hunted and trapped for fur in north america after european contact
as one of the most playful curious and active species of otter they have become a popular exhibit in zoos and aquaria but unwelcome on agricultural land because they alter river banks for access sliding and defense
river otters eat a variety of fish and shellfish as well as small land mammals and birds
they grow to 1 m (3 to 4 feet) in length and weigh from 5 to 15 kg (10 to 30 pounds)
in some areas this is a protected species and some places have otter sanctuaries which help ill and injured otters to recover
a sea otter in morro bay california sea otters (enhydra lutris) live along the pacific coast of north america
their historic range included shallow waters of the bering strait and kamchatka and as far south as japan
sea otters have some 200 00 hairs per square cm of skin a rich fur for which humans hunted them almost to extinction
by the time the 1911 fur seal treaty gave them protection so few sea otters remained that the fur trade had become unprofitable
sea otters eat shellfish and other invertebrates (especially clams abalone and sea urchins ) frequently using rocks as crude tools to smash open shells
they grow to 1 to 1 5 m (2 5 to 5 feet) in length and weigh 30 kg (about 65 pounds)
although once near extinction they have begun to spread again from remnant populations in california and alaska
unlike most marine mammals such as (seals or whales) sea otters do not have a layer of insulating blubber
as with other species of otter they rely on a layer of air trapped in their fur which they keep topped up by blowing into the fur from their mouths
they spend most of their time in the water whereas other otters spend much of their time on land
this sub species (lutrogale perspicillata maxwelli) of the smooth coated otter was the subject of the book ring of bright water by the british naturalist gavin maxwell and is named after him
it is native to the tigris euphrates alluvial salt marsh of iraq but it has been suggested that it may have become extinct as a result of the large scale drainage that has taken place in the region since the 1960s
eurasian otter this species (lutra lutra) inhabits europe and its range also extends across most of asia and parts of north africa
in the british isles they occurred commonly as recently as the 1950s but became rare in many areas due to the use of chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides and as a result of habitat loss and water pollution (they remained relatively common in parts of scotland and ireland)
population levels attained a low point in the 1980s but are now recovering strongly and by 199 estimated numbers indicated a recovery to under 100 animals
the uk biodiversity action plan envisages the re establishment of otters by 2010 in all the uk rivers and coastal areas that they inhabited in 1960
roadkill deaths have become one of the significant threats to the success of their re establishment
the giant otter (pteronura brasiliensis) inhabits south america especially the amazon river basin but is becoming increasingly rare due to poaching habitat loss and the use of mercury and other toxins in illegal alluvial gold mining
this gregarious animal grows to a length of up to 1 8 metres (6 feet) and is more aquatic than most other otters
"the word ""otter"" derives from the old english word otr otor or oter"
"this and cognate words in other indo european languages ultimately stem from a root which also gave rise to the english words ""water"" ""wet"" and ""winter"""
norse mythology tells of the dwarf ótr habitually taking the form of an otter
the myth of otter's ransom is the starting point of the volsunga saga
in some native american cultures otters are considered totem animals
the time of year associated with this is also associated with the aquarius sign of the zodiac through which the sun passes january 20 february 19
