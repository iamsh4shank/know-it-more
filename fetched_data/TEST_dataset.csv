he was the de facto leader of the french republic as first consul from 1799 to 1804 then emperor of the french from 1804 until 1814 and again in 1815
napoleon's political and cultural legacy endures to this day as a highly celebrated and controversial leader
he initiated many liberal reforms that have persisted in society and is considered one of the greatest military commanders in history
his campaigns are still studied at military academies worldwide
between three and six million civilians and soldiers died in what became known as the napoleonic wars
[2][3] napoleon was born on the island of corsica not long after its annexation by france to a native family descending from minor italian nobility
[4][5] he supported the french revolution in 1789 while serving in the french army and tried to spread its ideals to his native corsica
he rose rapidly in the army after he saved the governing french directory by firing on royalist insurgents
in 1796 he began a military campaign against the austrians and their italian allies scoring decisive victories and becoming a national hero
two years later he led a military expedition to egypt that served as a springboard to political power
he engineered a coup in november 1799 and became first consul of the republic
differences with the united kingdom meant france faced the war of the third coalition by 1805
napoleon shattered this coalition with victories in the ulm campaign and at the battle of austerlitz which led to the dissolution of the holy roman empire
in 1806 the fourth coalition took up arms against him
napoleon defeated prussia at the battles of jena and auerstedt marched the grande armée into eastern europe and defeated the russians in june 1807 at friedland forcing the defeated nations of the fourth coalition to accept the treaties of tilsit
two years later the austrians challenged the french again during the war of the fifth coalition but napoleon solidified his grip over europe after triumphing at the battle of wagram
hoping to extend the continental system his embargo against britain napoleon invaded the iberian peninsula and declared his brother joseph the king of spain in 1808
the spanish and the portuguese revolted in the peninsular war aided by a british army culminating in defeat for napoleon's marshals
napoleon launched an invasion of russia in the summer of 1812
the resulting campaign witnessed the catastrophic retreat of napoleon's grande armée
in 1813 prussia and austria joined russian forces in a sixth coalition against france resulting in a large coalition army defeating napoleon at the battle of leipzig
the coalition invaded france and captured paris forcing napoleon to abdicate in april 1814
he was exiled to the island of elba between corsica and italy
in france the bourbons were restored to power
napoleon escaped in february 1815 and took control of france
[6] the allies responded by forming a seventh coalition which defeated napoleon at the battle of waterloo in june 1815
the british exiled him to the remote island of saint helena in the atlantic where he died in 1821 at the age of 51
napoleon had an extensive impact on the modern world bringing liberal reforms to the lands he conquered especially the regions of the low countries switzerland and parts of modern italy and germany
he implemented many liberal policies in france and western europe
[c] early life napoleon's father carlo buonaparte fought for corsican independence under pasquale paoli but after their defeat he eventually became the island's representative to the court of louis xvi
napoleon's family was of italian origin
his paternal ancestors the buonapartes descended from a minor tuscan noble family who emigrated to corsica in the 16th century and his maternal ancestors the ramolinos descended from a minor genoese noble family
[13] the buonapartes were also the relatives by marriage and by birth of the pietrasentas costas paraviccinis and bonellis all corsican families of the interior
"[14] his parents carlo maria di buonaparte and maria letizia ramolino maintained an ancestral home called ""casa buonaparte"" in ajaccio"
napoleon was born there on 15 august 1769
he was the fourth child and third son of the family
[d] he had an elder brother joseph and younger siblings lucien elisa louis pauline caroline and jérôme
napoleon was baptised as a catholic under the name napoleone
[15] in his youth his name was also spelled as nabulione nabulio napolionne and napulione
[16] napoleon was born in the same year that the republic of genoa (former italian state) ceded the region of corsica to france
[17] the state sold sovereign rights a year before his birth and the island was conquered by france during the year of his birth
it was formally incorporated as a province in 1770 after 500 years under genoese rule and 14 years of independence
[e] napoleon's parents joined the corsican resistance and fought against the french to maintain independence even when maria was pregnant with him
his father carlo was an attorney who had supported and actively collaborated with patriot pasquale paoli during the corsican war of independence against france [5] after the corsican defeat at ponte novu in 1769 and paoli's exile in britain carlo began working for the new french government and went on to be named representative of the island to the court of louis xvi in 177
[5][21] the dominant influence of napoleon's childhood was his mother whose firm discipline restrained a rambunctious child
"[21] later in life napoleon stated ""the future destiny of the child is always the work of the mother"
"""[22] napoleon's maternal grandmother had married into the swiss fesch family in her second marriage and napoleon's uncle the cardinal joseph fesch would fulfill a role as protector of the bonaparte family for some years"
napoleon's noble moderately affluent background afforded him greater opportunities to study than were available to a typical corsican of the time
[23] statue of napoleon as a schoolboy in brienne aged 15 by louis rochet [fr] (1853) when he turned 9 years old [24][25] he moved to the french mainland and enrolled at a religious school in autun in january 1779
in may he transferred with a scholarship to a military academy at brienne le château
[26] in his youth he was an outspoken corsican nationalist and supported the state's independence from france
[24][27] like many corsicans napoleon spoke and read corsican (as his mother tongue) and italian (as the official language of corsica)
[28][29][30][27] he began learning french in school at around age 10
[31] although he became fluent in french he spoke with a distinctive corsican accent and never learned how to spell correctly in french
[32] consequently napoleon was treated unfairly by his schoolmates
[27] he was however not an isolated case as it was estimated in 1790 that fewer than 3 million people out of france's population of 28 million were able to speak standard french and those who could write it were even fewer
[33] napoleon was routinely bullied by his peers for his accent birthplace short stature mannerisms and inability to speak french quickly
[29] he became reserved and melancholy applying himself to reading
"an examiner observed that napoleon ""has always been distinguished for his application in mathematics"
he is fairly well acquainted with history and geography
"this boy would make an excellent sailor"""
[f][35] one story told of napoleon at the school is that he led junior students to victory against senior students in a snowball fight showing his leadership abilities
[36] in early adulthood napoleon briefly intended to become a writer he authored a history of corsica and a romantic novella
[24] on completion of his studies at brienne in 1784 napoleon was admitted to the école militaire in paris
he trained to become an artillery officer and when his father's death reduced his income was forced to complete the two year course in one year
[37] he was the first corsican to graduate from the école militaire
[37] he was examined by the famed scientist pierre simon laplace
[38] early career napoleon bonaparte aged 23 as lieutenant colonel of a battalion of corsican republican volunteers
portrait by henri félix emmanuel philippoteaux upon graduating in september 1785 bonaparte was commissioned a second lieutenant in la fère artillery regiment
[g][26] he served in valence and auxonne until after the outbreak of the french revolution in 1789
bonaparte was a fervent corsican nationalist during this period
[40] he asked for leave to join his mentor pasquale paoli when paoli was allowed to return to corsica by the national assembly
paoli had no sympathy for napoleon however as he deemed his father a traitor for having deserted his cause for corsican independence
[41] he spent the early years of the revolution in corsica fighting in a complex three way struggle among royalists revolutionaries and corsican nationalists
napoleon came to embrace the ideals of the revolution becoming a supporter of the jacobins and joining the pro french corsican republicans who opposed paoli's policy and his aspirations of secession
[42] he was given command over a battalion of volunteers and was promoted to captain in the regular army in july 1792 despite exceeding his leave of absence and leading a riot against french troops
[43] when corsica declared formal secession from france and requested the protection of the british government napoleon and his commitment to the french revolution came into conflict with paoli who had decided to sabotage the corsican contribution to the expédition de sardaigne by preventing a french assault on the sardinian island of la maddalena
[44] bonaparte and his family were compelled to flee to toulon on the french mainland in june 1793 because of the split with paoli
"[45] although he was born ""napoleone buonaparte"" it was after this that napoleon began styling himself ""napoléon bonaparte"""
his family did not drop the name buonaparte until 1796
the first known record of him signing his name as bonaparte was at the age of 27 (in 1796)
[46][15][47] siege of toulon main article siege of toulon bonaparte at the siege of toulon 1793 in july 1793 bonaparte published a pro republican pamphlet entitled le souper de beaucaire (supper at beaucaire) which gained him the support of augustin robespierre the younger brother of the revolutionary leader maximilien robespierre
with the help of his fellow corsican antoine christophe saliceti bonaparte was appointed senior gunner and artillery commander of the republican forces which arrived on 8 september at toulon
[48][49] he adopted a plan to capture a hill where republican guns could dominate the city's harbour and force the british to evacuate
the assault on the position led to the capture of the city and during it bonaparte was wounded in the thigh on 16 december
catching the attention of the committee of public safety he was put in charge of the artillery of france's army of italy
[50] on 22 december he was on his way to his new post in nice promoted from the rank of colonel to brigadier general at the age of 24
he devised plans for attacking the kingdom of sardinia as part of france's campaign against the first coalition
the french army carried out bonaparte's plan in the battle of saorgio in april 1794 and then advanced to seize ormea in the mountains
from ormea they headed west to outflank the austro sardinian positions around saorge
after this campaign augustin robespierre sent bonaparte on a mission to the republic of genoa to determine that country's intentions towards france
[51] 13 vendémiaire main article 13 vendémiaire some contemporaries alleged that bonaparte was put under house arrest at nice for his association with the robespierres following their fall in the thermidorian reaction in july 1794
napoleon's secretary bourrienne disputed the allegation in his memoirs
according to bourrienne jealousy was responsible between the army of the alps and the army of italy with whom napoleon was seconded at the time
[52] bonaparte dispatched an impassioned defence in a letter to the commissar saliceti and he was acquitted of any wrongdoing
[53] he was released within two weeks (on 20 august) and due to his technical skills was asked to draw up plans to attack italian positions in the context of france's war with austria
he also took part in an expedition to take back corsica from the british but the french were repulsed by the british royal navy
[54] by 1795 bonaparte had become engaged to désirée clary daughter of françois clary
désirée's sister julie clary had married bonaparte's elder brother joseph
[55] in april 1795 he was assigned to the army of the west which was engaged in the war in the vendée—a civil war and royalist counter revolution in vendée a region in west central france on the atlantic ocean
as an infantry command it was a demotion from artillery general—for which the army already had a full quota—and he pleaded poor health to avoid the posting
[56] journée du 13 vendémiaire artillery fire in front of the church of saint roch paris rue saint honoré he was moved to the bureau of topography of the committee of public safety
he sought unsuccessfully to be transferred to constantinople in order to offer his services to the sultan
[57] during this period he wrote the romantic novella clisson et eugénie about a soldier and his lover in a clear parallel to bonaparte's own relationship with désirée
[58] on 15 september bonaparte was removed from the list of generals in regular service for his refusal to serve in the vendée campaign
he faced a difficult financial situation and reduced career prospects
[59] on 3 october royalists in paris declared a rebellion against the national convention
[60] paul barras a leader of the thermidorian reaction knew of bonaparte's military exploits at toulon and gave him command of the improvised forces in defence of the convention in the tuileries palace
napoleon had seen the massacre of the king's swiss guard there three years earlier and realized that artillery would be the key to its defence
[26] he ordered a young cavalry officer named joachim murat to seize large cannons and used them to repel the attackers on 5 october 1795—13 vendémiaire an iv in the french republican calendar
1 400 royalists died and the rest fled
"[60] he cleared the streets with ""a whiff of grapeshot"" according to 19th century historian thomas carlyle in the french revolution a history"
[61][62] the defeat of the royalist insurrection extinguished the threat to the convention and earned bonaparte sudden fame wealth and the patronage of the new government the directory
murat married one of napoleon's sisters becoming his brother in law he also served under napoleon as one of his generals
bonaparte was promoted to commander of the interior and given command of the army of italy
[45] within weeks he was romantically involved with joséphine de beauharnais the former mistress of barras
the couple married on 9 march 1796 in a civil ceremony
[63] first italian campaign main article italian campaigns of the french revolutionary wars bonaparte at the pont d'arcole by baron antoine jean gros (c 1801) musée du louvre paris two days after the marriage bonaparte left paris to take command of the army of italy
he immediately went on the offensive hoping to defeat the forces of piedmont before their austrian allies could intervene
in a series of rapid victories during the montenotte campaign he knocked piedmont out of the war in two weeks
the french then focused on the austrians for the remainder of the war the highlight of which became the protracted struggle for mantua
the austrians launched a series of offensives against the french to break the siege but napoleon defeated every relief effort scoring victories at the battles of castiglione bassano arcole and rivoli
the decisive french triumph at rivoli in january 1797 led to the collapse of the austrian position in italy
at rivoli the austrians lost up to 14 00 men while the french lost about 5 00
[64] the next phase of the campaign featured the french invasion of the habsburg heartlands
french forces in southern germany had been defeated by the archduke charles in 1796 but the archduke withdrew his forces to protect vienna after learning about napoleon's assault
in the first encounter between the two commanders napoleon pushed back his opponent and advanced deep into austrian territory after winning at the battle of tarvis in march 1797
the austrians were alarmed by the french thrust that reached all the way to leoben about 100 km from vienna and decided to sue for peace
[65] the treaty of leoben followed by the more comprehensive treaty of campo formio gave france control of most of northern italy and the low countries and a secret clause promised the republic of venice to austria
bonaparte marched on venice and forced its surrender ending 1 100 years of venetian independence
he authorized the french to loot treasures such as the horses of saint mark
[66] on the journey bonaparte conversed much about the warriors of antiquity especially alexander caesar scipio and hannibal
he studied their strategy and combined it with his own
in a question from bourrienne asking whether he gave his preference to alexander or caesar napoleon said that he places alexander the great in the first rank the main reason being his campaign in asia
[67] bonaparte during the italian campaign in 1797 his application of conventional military ideas to real world situations enabled his military triumphs such as creative use of artillery as a mobile force to support his infantry
he stated later in life [when ]
"""i have fought sixty battles and i have learned nothing which i did not know at the beginning"
"look at caesar he fought the first like the last"""
"[68] bonaparte could win battles by concealment of troop deployments and concentration of his forces on the ""hinge"" of an enemy's weakened front"
if he could not use his favourite envelopment strategy he would take up the central position and attack two co operating forces at their hinge swing round to fight one until it fled then turn to face the other
[69] in this italian campaign bonaparte's army captured 150 00 prisoners 540 cannons and 170 standards
[70] the french army fought 67 actions and won 18 pitched battles through superior artillery technology and bonaparte's tactics
[71] during the campaign bonaparte became increasingly influential in french politics
he founded two newspapers one for the troops in his army and another for circulation in france
[72] the royalists attacked bonaparte for looting italy and warned that he might become a dictator
[73] napoleon's forces extracted an estimated $45 million in funds from italy during their campaign there another $12 million in precious metals and jewels
his forces confiscated more than 300 priceless paintings and sculptures
[74] bonaparte sent general pierre augereau to paris to lead a coup d'état and purge the royalists on 4 september—the coup of 18 fructidor
this left barras and his republican allies in control again but dependent upon bonaparte who proceeded to peace negotiations with austria
these negotiations resulted in the treaty of campo formio
bonaparte returned to paris in december 1797 as a hero
[75] he met talleyrand france's new foreign minister—who served in the same capacity for emperor napoleon—and they began to prepare for an invasion of britain
[45] egyptian expedition main article french campaign in egypt and syria bonaparte before the sphinx (c 1886) by jean léon gérôme hearst castle after two months of planning bonaparte decided that france's naval strength was not yet sufficient to confront the british royal navy
he decided on a military expedition to seize egypt and thereby undermine britain's access to its trade interests in india
[45] bonaparte wished to establish a french presence in the middle east and join forces with tipu sultan the sultan of mysore who was an enemy of the british
"[76] napoleon assured the directory that ""as soon as he had conquered egypt he will establish relations with the indian princes and together with them attack the english in their possessions"""
[77] the directory agreed in order to secure a trade route to the indian subcontinent
[78] in may 1798 bonaparte was elected a member of the french academy of sciences
his egyptian expedition included a group of 167 scientists with mathematicians naturalists chemists and geodesists among them
their discoveries included the rosetta stone and their work was published in the description de l'égypte in 1809
[79] battle of the pyramids on 21 july 1798 by louis françois baron lejeune 1808 en route to egypt bonaparte reached malta on 9 june 1798 then controlled by the knights hospitaller
grand master ferdinand von hompesch zu bolheim surrendered after token resistance and bonaparte captured an important naval base with the loss of only three men
[80] bonaparte and his expedition eluded pursuit by the royal navy and landed at alexandria on 1 july
[45] he fought the battle of shubra khit against the mamluks egypt's ruling military caste
this helped the french practise their defensive tactic for the battle of the pyramids fought on 21 july about 24 km (15 mi) from the pyramids
general bonaparte's forces of 25 00 roughly equalled those of the mamluks' egyptian cavalry
twenty nine french[81] and approximately 2 00 egyptians were killed
the victory boosted the morale of the french army
[82] on 1 august 1798 the british fleet under sir horatio nelson captured or destroyed all but two vessels of the french fleet in the battle of the nile defeating bonaparte's goal to strengthen the french position in the mediterranean
[83] his army had succeeded in a temporary increase of french power in egypt though it faced repeated uprisings
[84] in early 1799 he moved an army into the ottoman province of damascus (syria and galilee)
bonaparte led these 13 00 french soldiers in the conquest of the coastal towns of arish gaza jaffa and haifa
[85] the attack on jaffa was particularly brutal
bonaparte discovered that many of the defenders were former prisoners of war ostensibly on parole so he ordered the garrison and some 1 500–2 00 prisoners to be executed by bayonet or drowning
[86] men women and children were robbed and murdered for three days
[87] bonaparte began with an army of 13 00 men
1 500 were reported missing 1 200 died in combat and thousands perished from disease—mostly bubonic plague
he failed to reduce the fortress of acre so he marched his army back to egypt in may
to speed up the retreat bonaparte ordered plague stricken men to be poisoned with opium
the number who died remains disputed ranging from a low of 30 to a high of 580
he also brought out 1 00 wounded men
[88] back in egypt on 25 july bonaparte defeated an ottoman amphibious invasion at abukir
[89] ruler of france main articles 18 brumaire and napoleonic era general bonaparte surrounded by members of the council of five hundred during the coup of 18 brumaire by françois bouchot while in egypt bonaparte stayed informed of european affairs
he learned that france had suffered a series of defeats in the war of the second coalition
[90] on 24 august 1799 fearing that the republic's future was in doubt he took advantage of the temporary departure of british ships from french coastal ports and set sail for france despite the fact that he had received no explicit orders from paris
[91] the army was left in the charge of jean baptiste kléber
[92] unknown to bonaparte the directory had sent him orders to return to ward off possible invasions of french soil but poor lines of communication prevented the delivery of these messages
[90] by the time that he reached paris in october france's situation had been improved by a series of victories
the republic however was bankrupt and the ineffective directory was unpopular with the french population
"[93] the directory discussed bonaparte's ""desertion"" but was too weak to punish him"
[90] despite the failures in egypt napoleon returned to a hero's welcome
"he drew together an alliance with director emmanuel joseph sieyès his brother lucien speaker of the council of five hundred roger ducos director joseph fouché and talleyrand and they overthrew the directory by a coup d'état on 9 november 1799 (""the 18th brumaire"" according to the revolutionary calendar) closing down the council of five hundred"
"napoleon became ""first consul"" for ten years with two consuls appointed by him who had consultative voices only"
"his power was confirmed by the new ""constitution of the year vii"" originally devised by sieyès to give napoleon a minor role but rewritten by napoleon and accepted by direct popular vote (3 00 00 in favour 1 567 opposed)"
the constitution preserved the appearance of a republic but in reality established a dictatorship
[94][95] french consulate main articles french consulate and war of the second coalition bonaparte first consul by ingres
posing the hand inside the waistcoat was often used in portraits of rulers to indicate calm and stable leadership
"silver coin 5 francs_an xi 1802 bonaparte first consul napoleon established a political system that historian martyn lyons called ""dictatorship by plebiscite"""
[96] worried by the democratic forces unleashed by the revolution but unwilling to ignore them entirely napoleon resorted to regular electoral consultations with the french people on his road to imperial power
[96] he drafted the constitution of the year vii and secured his own election as first consul taking up residence at the tuileries
"the constitution was approved in a rigged plebiscite held the following january with 99 94 percent officially listed as voting ""yes"""
[97] napoleon's brother lucien had falsified the returns to show that 3 million people had participated in the plebiscite
the real number was 1 5 million
[96] political observers at the time assumed the eligible french voting public numbered about 5 million people so the regime artificially doubled the participation rate to indicate popular enthusiasm for the consulate
[96] in the first few months of the consulate with war in europe still raging and internal instability still plaguing the country napoleon's grip on power remained very tenuous
[98] in the spring of 1800 napoleon and his troops crossed the swiss alps into italy aiming to surprise the austrian armies that had reoccupied the peninsula when napoleon was still in egypt
[h] after a difficult crossing over the alps the french army entered the plains of northern italy virtually unopposed
[100] while one french army approached from the north the austrians were busy with another stationed in genoa which was besieged by a substantial force
the fierce resistance of this french army under andré masséna gave the northern force some time to carry out their operations with little interference
[101] the battle of marengo was napoleon's first great victory as head of state
after spending several days looking for each other the two armies collided at the battle of marengo on 14 june
general melas had a numerical advantage fielding about 30 00 austrian soldiers while napoleon commanded 24 00 french troops
[102] the battle began favourably for the austrians as their initial attack surprised the french and gradually drove them back
melas stated that he had won the battle and retired to his headquarters around 3 pm leaving his subordinates in charge of pursuing the french
[103] the french lines never broke during their tactical retreat
napoleon constantly rode out among the troops urging them to stand and fight
[104] late in the afternoon a full division under desaix arrived on the field and reversed the tide of the battle
a series of artillery barrages and cavalry charges decimated the austrian army which fled over the bormida river back to alessandria leaving behind 14 00 casualties
[104] the following day the austrian army agreed to abandon northern italy once more with the convention of alessandria which granted them safe passage to friendly soil in exchange for their fortresses throughout the region
[104] although critics have blamed napoleon for several tactical mistakes preceding the battle they have also praised his audacity for selecting a risky campaign strategy choosing to invade the italian peninsula from the north when the vast majority of french invasions came from the west near or along the coastline
[105] as david g chandler points out napoleon spent almost a year getting the austrians out of italy in his first campaign
in 1800 it took him only a month to achieve the same goal
"[105] german strategist and field marshal alfred von schlieffen concluded that ""bonaparte did not annihilate his enemy but eliminated him and rendered him harmless"" while attaining ""the object of the campaign the conquest of north italy"""
[106] napoleon's triumph at marengo secured his political authority and boosted his popularity back home but it did not lead to an immediate peace
bonaparte's brother joseph led the complex negotiations in lunéville and reported that austria emboldened by british support would not acknowledge the new territory that france had acquired
as negotiations became increasingly fractious bonaparte gave orders to his general moreau to strike austria once more
moreau and the french swept through bavaria and scored an overwhelming victory at hohenlinden in december 1800
as a result the austrians capitulated and signed the treaty of lunéville in february 1801
the treaty reaffirmed and expanded earlier french gains at campo formio
[107] temporary peace in europe see also haitian revolution after a decade of constant warfare france and britain signed the treaty of amiens in march 1802 bringing the revolutionary wars to an end
amiens called for the withdrawal of british troops from recently conquered colonial territories as well as for assurances to curtail the expansionary goals of the french republic
[101] with europe at peace and the economy recovering napoleon's popularity soared to its highest levels under the consulate both domestically and abroad
[108] in a new plebiscite during the spring of 1802 the french public came out in huge numbers to approve a constitution that made the consulate permanent essentially elevating napoleon to dictator for life
[108] whereas the plebiscite two years earlier had brought out 1 5 million people to the polls the new referendum enticed 3 6 million to go and vote (72 percent of all eligible voters)
[109] there was no secret ballot in 1802 and few people wanted to openly defy the regime
the constitution gained approval with over 99% of the vote
[109] his broad powers were spelled out in the new constitution article 1
the french people name and the senate proclaims napoleon bonaparte first consul for life
[110] after 1802 he was generally referred to as napoleon rather than bonaparte
[39] the 1803 louisiana purchase totalled 2 144 480 square kilometres (827 987 square miles) doubling the size of the united states
the brief peace in europe allowed napoleon to focus on french colonies abroad
saint domingue had managed to acquire a high level of political autonomy during the revolutionary wars with toussaint l'ouverture installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801
napoleon saw a chance to reestablish control over the colony when he signed the treaty of amiens
in the 18th century saint domingue had been france's most profitable colony producing more sugar than all the british west indies colonies combined
however during the revolution the national convention voted to abolish slavery in february 1794
[11] aware of the expenses required to fund his wars in europe napoleon made the decision to reinstate slavery in all french caribbean colonies
the 1794 decree had only affected the colonies of saint domingue guadeloupe and guiana and did not take effect in mauritius reunion and martinique the last of which had been captured by the british and as such remained unaffected by french law
[112] in guadeloupe slavery had been abolished (and its ban violently enforced) by victor hugues against opposition from slaveholders thanks to the 1794 law
however when slavery was reinstated in 1802 a slave revolt broke out under the leadership of louis delgrès
[113] the resulting law of 20 may had the express purpose of reinstating slavery in saint domingue guadeloupe and french guiana and restored slavery throughout most of the french colonial empire (excluding saint domingue) for another half a century while the french transatlantic slave trade continued for another twenty years
[114][115][116][117][118] napoleon sent an expedition under his brother in law general leclerc to reassert control over saint domingue
although the french managed to capture toussaint louverture the expedition failed when high rates of disease crippled the french army and jean jacques dessalines won a string of victories first against leclerc and when he died from yellow fever then against donatien marie joseph de vimeur vicomte de rochambeau whom napoleon sent to relieve leclerc with another 20 00 men
in may 1803 napoleon acknowledged defeat and the last 8 00 french troops left the island and the slaves proclaimed an independent republic that they called haiti in 1804
in the process dessalines became arguably the most successful military commander in the struggle against napoleonic france
[119][120] seeing the failure of his efforts in haiti napoleon decided in 1803 to sell the louisiana territory to the united states instantly doubling the size of the u s
the selling price in the louisiana purchase was less than three cents per acre a total of $15 million
[2][121] the peace with britain proved to be uneasy and controversial
[122] britain did not evacuate malta as promised and protested against bonaparte's annexation of piedmont and his act of mediation which established a new swiss confederation
neither of these territories were covered by amiens but they inflamed tensions significantly
[123] the dispute culminated in a declaration of war by britain in may 1803 napoleon responded by reassembling the invasion camp at boulogne and declaring that every british male between eighteen and sixty years old in france and its dependencies to be arrested as a prisoner of war
[124] french empire main article first french empire see also coronation of napoleon i and napoleonic wars the coronation of napoleon by jacques louis david (1804) during the consulate napoleon faced several royalist and jacobin assassination plots including the conspiration des poignards (dagger plot) in october 1800 and the plot of the rue saint nicaise (also known as the infernal machine) two months later
[125] in january 1804 his police uncovered an assassination plot against him that involved moreau and which was ostensibly sponsored by the bourbon family the former rulers of france
on the advice of talleyrand napoleon ordered the kidnapping of the duke of enghien violating the sovereignty of baden
the duke was quickly executed after a secret military trial even though he had not been involved in the plot
[126] enghien's execution infuriated royal courts throughout europe becoming one of the contributing political factors for the outbreak of the napoleonic wars
to expand his power napoleon used these assassination plots to justify the creation of an imperial system based on the roman model
he believed that a bourbon restoration would be more difficult if his family's succession was entrenched in the constitution
[127] launching yet another referendum napoleon was elected as emperor of the french by a tally exceeding 99%
[109] as with the life consulate two years earlier this referendum produced heavy participation bringing out almost 3 6 million voters to the polls
"[109] a keen observer of bonaparte's rise to absolute power madame de rémusat explains that ""men worn out by the turmoil of the revolution […] looked for the domination of an able ruler"" and that ""people believed quite sincerely that bonaparte whether as consul or emperor would exert his authority and save [them] from the perils of anarchy"
"""[128]"" napoleon's throne room at fontainebleau coronation napoleon's coronation at which pope pius vii officiated took place at notre dame de paris on 2 december 1804"
the ceremony more or less lasted around three hours so the guests who arrived earlier became dull or bored and had to go in out and of the cathedral to at least rejuvenate their spirits and also to buy food and drink
[129] two separate crowns were brought for the ceremony a golden laurel wreath recalling the roman empire and a replica of charlemagne's crown
[130] napoleon entered the ceremony wearing the laurel wreath and kept it on his head throughout the proceedings[130] since the laurel wreath symbolized victory peace and civic virtue
[129] for the official coronation he raised the replica charlemagne crown over his own head in a symbolic gesture but never placed it on top because he was already wearing the golden wreath
[130] after the crown was placed on his head everyone in the notre dame cathedral stood up spontaneously the men waving their feathered hats
[131] josephine his wife knelt in front of napoleon where he then placed the crown on josephine's head the event commemorated in the officially sanctioned painting by jacques louis david
[130] josephine became only the second queen to be crowned and anointed in french history other than marie de' medici
[132] napoleon was then crowned king of italy with the iron crown of lombardy at the cathedral of milan on 26 may 1805
he created eighteen marshals of the empire from among his top generals to secure the allegiance of the army on 18 may 1804 the official start of the empire
[133] war of the third coalition main article war of the third coalition napoleon and the grande armée receive the surrender of austrian general mack after the battle of ulm in october 1805
the decisive finale of the ulm campaign raised the tally of captured austrian soldiers to 60 00
with the austrian army destroyed vienna would fall to the french in november
great britain had broken the peace of amiens by declaring war on france in may 1803
[134] in december 1804 an anglo swedish agreement became the first step towards the creation of the third coalition
by april 1805 britain had also signed an alliance with russia
[135] austria had been defeated by france twice in recent memory and wanted revenge so it joined the coalition a few months later
[136] before the formation of the third coalition napoleon had assembled an invasion force the armée d'angleterre around six camps at boulogne in northern france
he intended to use this invasion force to strike at england
they never invaded but napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for future military operations
[137] the men at boulogne formed the core for what napoleon later called la grande armée
at the start this french army had about 200 00 men organized into seven corps which were large field units that contained 36–40 cannons each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue
[138] a single corps properly situated in a strong defensive position could survive at least a day without support giving the grande armée countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign
on top of these forces napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22 00 organized into two cuirassier divisions four mounted dragoon divisions one division of dismounted dragoons and one of light cavalry all supported by 24 artillery pieces
[139] by 1805 the grande armée had grown to a force of 350 00 men [139] who were well equipped well trained and led by competent officers
[140] napoleon knew that the french fleet could not defeat the royal navy in a head to head battle so he planned to lure it away from the english channel through diversionary tactics
[141] the main strategic idea involved the french navy escaping from the british blockades of toulon and brest and threatening to attack the british west indies
in the face of this attack it was hoped the british would weaken their defence of the western approaches by sending ships to the caribbean allowing a combined franco spanish fleet to take control of the english channel long enough for french armies to cross and invade
[141] however the plan unravelled after the british victory at the battle of cape finisterre in july 1805
french admiral villeneuve then retreated to cádiz instead of linking up with french naval forces at brest for an attack on the english channel
[142] napoléon in his coronation robes by françois gérard c 1805 by august 1805 napoleon had realized that the strategic situation had changed fundamentally
facing a potential invasion from his continental enemies he decided to strike first and turned his army's sights from the english channel to the rhine
his basic objective was to destroy the isolated austrian armies in southern germany before their russian allies could arrive
on 25 september after great secrecy and feverish marching 200 00 french troops began to cross the rhine on a front of 260 km (160 mi)
[143][144] austrian commander karl mack had gathered the greater part of the austrian army at the fortress of ulm in swabia
napoleon swung his forces to the southeast and the grande armée performed an elaborate wheeling movement that outflanked the austrian positions
the ulm maneuver completely surprised general mack who belatedly understood that his army had been cut off
after some minor engagements that culminated in the battle of ulm mack finally surrendered after realizing that there was no way to break out of the french encirclement
for just 2 00 french casualties napoleon had managed to capture a total of 60 00 austrian soldiers through his army's rapid marching
"[145] napoleon wrote after the conflict ""i have accomplished my object i have destroyed the austrian army by simply marching"
"""[146] the ulm campaign is generally regarded as a strategic masterpiece and was influential in the development of the schlieffen plan in the late 19th century"
[147] for the french this spectacular victory on land was soured by the decisive victory that the royal navy attained at the battle of trafalgar on 21 october
after trafalgar the royal navy was never again seriously challenged by a french fleet in a large scale engagement for the duration of the napoleonic wars
[148] napoleon at the battle of austerlitz by françois gérard 1805
the battle of austerlitz also known as the battle of the three emperors was one of napoleon's many victories where the french empire defeated the third coalition
following the ulm campaign french forces managed to capture vienna in november
the fall of vienna provided the french a huge bounty as they captured 100 00 muskets 500 cannons and the intact bridges across the danube
[149] at this critical juncture both tsar alexander i and holy roman emperor francis ii decided to engage napoleon in battle despite reservations from some of their subordinates
napoleon sent his army north in pursuit of the allies but then ordered his forces to retreat so that he could feign a grave weakness
[150] desperate to lure the allies into battle napoleon gave every indication in the days preceding the engagement that the french army was in a pitiful state even abandoning the dominant pratzen heights a sloping hill near the village of austerlitz
at the battle of austerlitz in moravia on 2 december he deployed the french army below the pratzen heights and deliberately weakened his right flank enticing the allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling up the whole french line
a forced march from vienna by marshal davout and his ii corps plugged the gap left by napoleon just in time
[150] meanwhile the heavy allied deployment against the french right flank weakened their center on the pratzen heights which was viciously attacked by the iv corps of marshal soult
with the allied center demolished the french swept through both enemy flanks and sent the allies fleeing chaotically capturing thousands of prisoners in the process
the battle is often seen as a tactical masterpiece because of the near perfect execution of a calibrated but dangerous plan—of the same stature as cannae the celebrated triumph by hannibal some 2 00 years before
[150] the allied disaster at austerlitz significantly shook the faith of emperor francis in the british led war effort
france and austria agreed to an armistice immediately and the treaty of pressburg followed shortly after on 26 december
pressburg took austria out of both the war and the coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of campo formio and of lunéville between the two powers
the treaty confirmed the austrian loss of lands to france in italy and bavaria and lands in germany to napoleon's german allies
[151] it imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated habsburgs and allowed the fleeing russian troops free passage through hostile territories and back to their home soil
"napoleon went on to say ""the battle of austerlitz is the finest of all i have fought"""
"[152] frank mclynn suggests that napoleon was so successful at austerlitz that he lost touch with reality and what used to be french foreign policy became a ""personal napoleonic one"""
"[153] vincent cronin disagrees stating that napoleon was not overly ambitious for himself ""he embodied the ambitions of thirty million frenchmen"""
[154] middle eastern alliances main articles franco ottoman alliance and franco persian alliance the iranian envoy mirza mohammed reza qazvini meeting with napoleon i at the finckenstein palace in west prussia 27 april 1807 to sign the treaty of finckenstein napoleon continued to entertain a grand scheme to establish a french presence in the middle east in order to put pressure on britain and russia and perhaps form an alliance with the ottoman empire
[76] in february 1806 ottoman emperor selim ii recognised napoleon as emperor
"he also opted for an alliance with france calling france ""our sincere and natural ally"""
[155] that decision brought the ottoman empire into a losing war against russia and britain
a franco persian alliance was formed between napoleon and the persian empire of fat′h ali shah qajar
it collapsed in 1807 when france and russia formed an unexpected alliance
[76] in the end napoleon had made no effective alliances in the middle east
[156] war of the fourth coalition and tilsit main article war of the fourth coalition after austerlitz napoleon established the confederation of the rhine in 1806
a collection of german states intended to serve as a buffer zone between france and central europe the creation of the confederation spelled the end of the holy roman empire and significantly alarmed the prussians
the brazen reorganization of german territory by the french risked threatening prussian influence in the region if not eliminating it outright
war fever in berlin rose steadily throughout the summer of 1806
at the insistence of his court especially his wife queen louise frederick william ii decided to challenge the french domination of central europe by going to war
[157] napoleon reviewing the imperial guard before the battle of jena the initial military manoeuvres began in september 1806
"in a letter to marshal soult detailing the plan for the campaign napoleon described the essential features of napoleonic warfare and introduced the phrase le bataillon carré (""square battalion"")"
[158] in the bataillon carré system the various corps of the grande armée would march uniformly together in close supporting distance
[158] if any single corps was attacked the others could quickly spring into action and arrive to help
[159] napoleon invaded prussia with 180 00 troops rapidly marching on the right bank of the river saale
as in previous campaigns his fundamental objective was to destroy one opponent before reinforcements from another could tip the balance of the war
upon learning the whereabouts of the prussian army the french swung westwards and crossed the saale with overwhelming force
at the twin battles of jena and auerstedt fought on 14 october the french convincingly defeated the prussians and inflicted heavy casualties
with several major commanders dead or incapacitated the prussian king proved incapable of effectively commanding the army which began to quickly disintegrate
"[159] in a vaunted pursuit that epitomized the ""peak of napoleonic warfare"" according to historian richard brooks [159] the french managed to capture 140 00 soldiers over 2 00 cannons and hundreds of ammunition wagons all in a single month"
"historian david chandler wrote of the prussian forces ""never has the morale of any army been more completely shattered"""
[158] despite their overwhelming defeat the prussians refused to negotiate with the french until the russians had an opportunity to enter the fight
the treaties of tilsit napoleon meeting with alexander i of russia on a raft in the middle of the neman river following his triumph napoleon imposed the first elements of the continental system through the berlin decree issued in november 1806
the continental system which prohibited european nations from trading with britain was widely violated throughout his reign
[160][161] in the next few months napoleon marched against the advancing russian armies through poland and was involved in the bloody stalemate at the battle of eylau in february 1807
[162] after a period of rest and consolidation on both sides the war restarted in june with an initial struggle at heilsberg that proved indecisive
[163] on 14 june napoleon obtained an overwhelming victory over the russians at the battle of friedland wiping out the majority of the russian army in a very bloody struggle
the scale of their defeat convinced the russians to make peace with the french
on 19 june tsar alexander sent an envoy to seek an armistice with napoleon
the latter assured the envoy that the vistula river represented the natural borders between french and russian influence in europe
on that basis the two emperors began peace negotiations at the town of tilsit after meeting on an iconic raft on the river niemen
"the very first thing alexander said to napoleon was probably well calibrated ""i hate the english as much as you do"""
[163] their meeting lasted two hours
despite waging wars against each other the two emperors were very much impressed and fascinated by one another
“never ” said alexander afterward “did i love any man as i loved that man ”[164] alexander faced pressure from his brother duke constantine to make peace with napoleon
given the victory he had just achieved the french emperor offered the russians relatively lenient terms—demanding that russia join the continental system withdraw its forces from wallachia and moldavia and hand over the ionian islands to france
[165] by contrast napoleon dictated very harsh peace terms for prussia despite the ceaseless exhortations of queen louise
wiping out half of prussian territories from the map napoleon created a new kingdom of 2 800 square kilometres (1 100 sq mi) called westphalia and appointed his young brother jérôme as its monarch
[166] prussia's humiliating treatment at tilsit caused a deep and bitter antagonism that festered as the napoleonic era progressed
moreover alexander's pretensions at friendship with napoleon led the latter to seriously misjudge the true intentions of his russian counterpart who would violate numerous provisions of the treaty in the next few years
despite these problems the treaties of tilsit at last gave napoleon a respite from war and allowed him to return to france which he had not seen in over 300 days
[166] peninsular war and erfurt main article peninsular war the settlements at tilsit gave napoleon time to organize his empire
one of his major objectives became enforcing the continental system against the british forces
he decided to focus his attention on the kingdom of portugal which consistently violated his trade prohibitions
after defeat in the war of the oranges in 1801 portugal adopted a double sided policy
joseph bonaparte napoleon's brother as king of spain unhappy with this change of policy by the portuguese government napoleon negotiated a secret treaty with charles iv of spain and sent an army to invade portugal
[167] on 17 october 1807 24 00 french troops under general junot crossed the pyrenees with spanish cooperation and headed towards portugal to enforce napoleon's orders
[168] this attack was the first step in what would eventually become the peninsular war a six year struggle that significantly sapped french strength
throughout the winter of 1808 french agents became increasingly involved in spanish internal affairs attempting to incite discord between members of the spanish royal family
on 16 february 1808 secret french machinations finally materialized when napoleon announced that he would intervene to mediate between the rival political factions in the country
[169] marshal murat led 120 00 troops into spain
the french arrived in madrid on 24 march [170] where wild riots against the occupation erupted just a few weeks later
napoleon appointed his brother joseph bonaparte as the new king of spain in the summer of 1808
the appointment enraged a heavily religious and conservative spanish population
resistance to french aggression soon spread throughout spain
the shocking french defeats at the battle of bailén and the battle of vimiero gave hope to napoleon's enemies and partly persuaded the french emperor to intervene in person
[171] before going to iberia napoleon decided to address several lingering issues with the russians
at the congress of erfurt in october 1808 napoleon hoped to keep russia on his side during the upcoming struggle in spain and during any potential conflict against austria
"the two sides reached an agreement the erfurt convention that called upon britain to cease its war against france that recognized the russian conquest of finland from sweden and made it an autonomous grand duchy [172] and that affirmed russian support for france in a possible war against austria ""to the best of its ability"""
[173] napoleon then returned to france and prepared for war
the grande armée under the emperor's personal command rapidly crossed the ebro river in november 1808 and inflicted a series of crushing defeats against the spanish forces
after clearing the last spanish force guarding the capital at somosierra napoleon entered madrid on 4 december with 80 00 troops
[174] he then unleashed his soldiers against moore and the british forces
the british were swiftly driven to the coast and they withdrew from spain entirely after a last stand at the battle of corunna in january 1809 and the death of moore
[175] napoleon accepting the surrender of madrid 4 december 1808 napoleon would end up leaving iberia in order to deal with the austrians in central europe but the peninsular war continued on long after his absence
he never returned to spain after the 1808 campaign
several months after corunna the british sent another army to the peninsula under arthur wellesley the future duke of wellington
the war then settled into a complex and asymmetric strategic deadlock where all sides struggled to gain the upper hand
the highlight of the conflict became the brutal guerrilla warfare that engulfed much of the spanish countryside
both sides committed the worst atrocities of the napoleonic wars during this phase of the conflict
[176] the vicious guerrilla fighting in spain largely absent from the french campaigns in central europe severely disrupted the french lines of supply and communication
although france maintained roughly 300 00 troops in iberia during the peninsular war the vast majority were tied down to garrison duty and to intelligence operations
[176] the french were never able to concentrate all of their forces effectively prolonging the war until events elsewhere in europe finally turned the tide in favour of the allies
after the invasion of russia in 1812 the number of french troops in spain vastly declined as napoleon needed reinforcements to conserve his strategic position in europe
by 1814 the allies had pushed the french out of the peninsula
the impact of the napoleonic invasion of spain and ousting of the spanish bourbon monarchy in favour of his brother joseph had an enormous impact on the spanish empire
in spanish america many local elites formed juntas and set up mechanisms to rule in the name of ferdinand vii of spain whom they considered the legitimate spanish monarch
the outbreak of the spanish american wars of independence in most of the empire was a result of napoleon's destabilizing actions in spain and led to the rise of strongmen in the wake of these wars
[177] war of the fifth coalition and marie louise main article war of the fifth coalition napoleon at the battle of wagram painted by horace vernet after four years on the sidelines austria sought another war with france to avenge its recent defeats
austria could not count on russian support because the latter was at war with britain sweden and the ottoman empire in 1809
frederick william of prussia initially promised to help the austrians but reneged before conflict began
[178] a report from the austrian finance minister suggested that the treasury would run out of money by the middle of 1809 if the large army that the austrians had formed since the third coalition remained mobilized
"[178] although archduke charles warned that the austrians were not ready for another showdown with napoleon a stance that landed him in the so called ""peace party"" he did not want to see the army demobilized either"
[178] on 8 february 1809 the advocates for war finally succeeded when the imperial government secretly decided on another confrontation against the french
[179] in the early morning of 10 april leading elements of the austrian army crossed the inn river and invaded bavaria
the early austrian attack surprised the french napoleon himself was still in paris when he heard about the invasion
he arrived at donauwörth on the 17th to find the grande armée in a dangerous position with its two wings separated by 120 km (75 mi) and joined by a thin cordon of bavarian troops
charles pressed the left wing of the french army and hurled his men towards the ii corps of marshal davout
[180] in response napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the austrians in the celebrated landshut maneuver
[181] he realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of eckmühl
the french scored a convincing win in the resulting battle of eckmühl forcing charles to withdraw his forces over the danube and into bohemia
on 13 may vienna fell for the second time in four years although the war continued since most of the austrian army had survived the initial engagements in southern germany
the entry of napoleon in schönbrunn vienna on 21 may the french made their first major effort to cross the danube precipitating the battle of aspern essling
the battle was characterized by a vicious back and forth struggle for the two villages of aspern and essling the focal points of the french bridgehead
a sustained austrian artillery bombardment eventually convinced napoleon to withdraw his forces back onto lobau island
both sides inflicted about 23 00 casualties on each other
[182] it was the first defeat napoleon suffered in a major set piece battle and it caused excitement throughout many parts of europe because it proved that he could be beaten on the battlefield
[183] after the setback at aspern essling napoleon took more than six weeks in planning and preparing for contingencies before he made another attempt at crossing the danube
[184] from 30 june to the early days of july the french recrossed the danube in strength with more than 180 00 troops marching across the marchfeld towards the austrians
[184] charles received the french with 150 00 of his own men
[185] in the ensuing battle of wagram which also lasted two days napoleon commanded his forces in what was the largest battle of his career up until then
napoleon finished off the battle with a concentrated central thrust that punctured a hole in the austrian army and forced charles to retreat
austrian losses were very heavy reaching well over 40 00 casualties
[186] the french were too exhausted to pursue the austrians immediately but napoleon eventually caught up with charles at znaim and the latter signed an armistice on 12 july
the french empire at its greatest extent in 1812 french empire french satellite states in the kingdom of holland the british launched the walcheren campaign to open up a second front in the war and to relieve the pressure on the austrians
the british army only landed at walcheren on 30 july by which point the austrians had already been defeated
"the walcheren campaign was characterized by little fighting but heavy casualties thanks to the popularly dubbed ""walcheren fever"""
over 4 00 british troops were lost in a bungled campaign and the rest withdrew in december 1809
[187] the main strategic result from the campaign became the delayed political settlement between the french and the austrians
emperor francis waited to see how the british performed in their theatre before entering into negotiations with napoleon
once it became apparent the british were going nowhere the austrians agreed to peace talks
[citation needed] the resulting treaty of schönbrunn in october 1809 was the harshest that france had imposed on austria in recent memory
metternich and archduke charles had the preservation of the habsburg empire as their fundamental goal and to this end they succeeded by making napoleon seek more modest goals in return for promises of friendship between the two powers
[188] while most of the hereditary lands remained a part of the habsburg realm france received carinthia carniola and the adriatic ports while galicia was given to the poles and the salzburg area of the tyrol went to the bavarians
[188] austria lost over three million subjects about one fifth of her total population as a result of these territorial changes
[189] napoleon turned his focus to domestic affairs after the war
empress joséphine had still not given birth to a child from napoleon who became worried about the future of his empire following his death
desperate for a legitimate heir napoleon divorced joséphine on 10 january 1810 and started looking for a new wife
hoping to cement the recent alliance with austria through a family connection napoleon married the 18 year old archduchess marie louise daughter of emperor francis ii
on 20 march 1811 marie louise gave birth to a baby boy whom napoleon made heir apparent and bestowed the title of king of rome
his son never actually ruled the empire but given his brief titular rule and cousin louis napoléon's subsequent naming himself napoléon ii historians often refer to him as napoleon ii
[190] invasion of russia main article french invasion of russia in 1808 napoleon and tsar alexander met at the congress of erfurt to preserve the russo french alliance
the leaders had a friendly personal relationship after their first meeting at tilsit in 1807
[191] by 1811 however tensions had increased a strain on the relationship became the regular violations of the continental system by the russians as their economy was failing which led napoleon to threaten alexander with serious consequences if he formed an alliance with britain
[192] napoleon watching the fire of moscow in september 1812 by adam albrecht (1841) napoleon's withdrawal from russia painting by adolph northen by 1812 advisers to alexander suggested the possibility of an invasion of the french empire and the recapture of poland
on receipt of intelligence reports on russia's war preparations napoleon expanded his grande armée to more than 450 00 men
[193] he ignored repeated advice against an invasion of the russian heartland and prepared for an offensive campaign on 24 june 1812 the invasion commenced
[194] in an attempt to gain increased support from polish nationalists and patriots napoleon termed the war the second polish war—the first polish war had been the bar confederation uprising by polish nobles against russia in 1768
polish patriots wanted the russian part of poland to be joined with the duchy of warsaw and an independent poland created
this was rejected by napoleon who stated he had promised his ally austria this would not happen
napoleon refused to manumit the russian serfs because of concerns this might provoke a reaction in his army's rear
the serfs later committed atrocities against french soldiers during france's retreat
[195] the russians avoided napoleon's objective of a decisive engagement and instead retreated deeper into russia
a brief attempt at resistance was made at smolensk in august the russians were defeated in a series of battles and napoleon resumed his advance
the russians again avoided battle although in a few cases this was only achieved because napoleon uncharacteristically hesitated to attack when the opportunity arose
owing to the russian army's scorched earth tactics the french found it increasingly difficult to forage food for themselves and their horses
[196] the russians eventually offered battle outside moscow on 7 september the battle of borodino resulted in approximately 44 00 russian and 35 00 french dead wounded or captured and may have been the bloodiest day of battle in history up to that point in time
[197] although the french had won the russian army had accepted and withstood the major battle napoleon had hoped would be decisive
"napoleon's own account was ""the most terrible of all my battles was the one before moscow"
"the french showed themselves to be worthy of victory but the russians showed themselves worthy of being invincible"""
[198] the russian army withdrew and retreated past moscow
napoleon entered the city assuming its fall would end the war and alexander would negotiate peace
moscow was burned rather than surrendered on the order of moscow's governor feodor rostopchin
after five weeks napoleon and his army left
in early november napoleon became concerned about the loss of control back in france after the malet coup of 1812
his army walked through snow up to their knees and nearly 10 00 men and horses froze to death on the night of 8/9 november alone
after the battle of berezina napoleon managed to escape but had to abandon much of the remaining artillery and baggage train
on 5 december shortly before arriving in vilnius napoleon left the army in a sledge
[199] the french suffered in the course of a ruinous retreat including from the harshness of the russian winter
the armée had begun as over 400 00 frontline troops with fewer than 40 00 crossing the berezina river in november 1812
[200] the russians had lost 150 00 soldiers in battle and hundreds of thousands of civilians
[201] war of the sixth coalition main article war of the sixth coalition napoleon's farewell to his imperial guard 20 april 1814 by antoine alphonse montfort there was a lull in fighting over the winter of 1812–13 while both the russians and the french rebuilt their forces napoleon was able to field 350 00 troops
[202] heartened by france's loss in russia prussia joined with austria sweden russia great britain spain and portugal in a new coalition
napoleon assumed command in germany and inflicted a series of defeats on the coalition culminating in the battle of dresden in august 1813
[203] despite these successes the numbers continued to mount against napoleon and the french army was pinned down by a force twice its size and lost at the battle of leipzig
this was by far the largest battle of the napoleonic wars and cost more than 90 00 casualties in total
[204] the allies offered peace terms in the frankfurt proposals in november 1813
"napoleon would remain as emperor of the french but it would be reduced to its ""natural frontiers"""
that meant that france could retain control of belgium savoy and the rhineland (the west bank of the rhine river) while giving up control of all the rest including all of spain and the netherlands and most of italy and germany
metternich told napoleon these were the best terms the allies were likely to offer after further victories the terms would be harsher and harsher
metternich's motivation was to maintain france as a balance against russian threats while ending the highly destabilizing series of wars
[205] napoleon expecting to win the war delayed too long and lost this opportunity by december the allies had withdrawn the offer
when his back was to the wall in 1814 he tried to reopen peace negotiations on the basis of accepting the frankfurt proposals
the allies now had new harsher terms that included the retreat of france to its 1791 boundaries which meant the loss of belgium but napoleon would remain emperor
however he rejected the term
the british wanted napoleon permanently removed and they prevailed though napoleon adamantly refused
[205][206] napoleon after his abdication in fontainebleau 4 april 1814 by paul delaroche napoleon withdrew into france his army reduced to 70 00 soldiers and little cavalry he faced more than three times as many allied troops
[207] joseph bonaparte napoleon's older brother abdicated as king of spain on 13 december 1813 and assumed the title of lieutenant general to save the collapsing empire
the french were surrounded british armies pressed from the south and other coalition forces positioned to attack from the german states
by the middle of january 1814 the coalition had already entered france's borders and launched a two pronged attack on paris with prussia entering from the north and austria from the east marching out of the capitulated swiss confederation
the french empire however would not go down so easily
napoleon launched a series of victories in the six days' campaign
while they repulsed the coalition forces and delayed the capture of paris by at least a full month these were not significant enough to turn the tide
the coalitionaries camped on the outskirts of the capital on 29 march
a day later they advanced onto the demoralised soldiers protecting the city
joseph bonaparte led a final battle at the gates of paris
they were greatly outnumbered as 30 00 french soldiers were pitted against a combined coalition force that was 5 times greater than theirs
they were defeated and joseph retreated out of the city
the leaders of paris surrendered to the coalition on the last day of march 1814
[208] on 1 april alexander addressed the sénat conservateur
long docile to napoleon under talleyrand's prodding it had turned against him
alexander told the sénat that the allies were fighting against napoleon not france and they were prepared to offer honourable peace terms if napoleon were removed from power
"the next day the sénat passed the acte de déchéance de l'empereur (""emperor's demise act"") which declared napoleon deposed"
napoleon had advanced as far as fontainebleau when he learned that paris had fallen
when napoleon proposed the army march on the capital his senior officers and marshals mutinied
[209] on 4 april led by ney the senior officers confronted napoleon
when napoleon asserted the army would follow him ney replied the army would follow its generals
while the ordinary soldiers and regimental officers wanted to fight on the senior commanders were unwilling to continue
without any senior officers or marshals any prospective invasion of paris would have been impossible
bowing to the inevitable on 4 april napoleon abdicated in favour of his son with marie louise as regent
however the allies refused to accept this under prodding from alexander who feared that napoleon might find an excuse to retake the throne
[210][211] napoleon was then forced to announce his unconditional abdication only two days later
"[211] in his farewell address to the soldiers of old guard in 20 april napoleon said ""soldiers of my old guard i have come to bid you farewell"
for twenty years you have accompanied me faithfully on the paths of honor and glory
with men like you our cause was [not] lost but the war would have dragged on interminably and it would have been a civil war
""
so i am sacrificing our interests to those of our country
do not lament my fate if i have agreed to live on it is to serve our glory
i wish to write the history of the great deeds we have done together
farewell my children

they gave him sovereignty over the island and allowed him to retain the title of emperor
napoleon attempted suicide with a pill he had carried after nearly being captured by the russians during the retreat from moscow
its potency had weakened with age however and he survived to be exiled while his wife and son took refuge in austria
[214] he was conveyed to the island on hms undaunted by captain thomas ussher and he arrived at portoferraio on 30 may 1814
in the first few months on elba he created a small navy and army developed the iron mines oversaw the construction of new roads issued decrees on modern agricultural methods and overhauled the island's legal and educational system
[215][216] a few months into his exile napoleon learned that his ex wife josephine had died in france
he was devastated by the news locking himself in his room and refusing to leave for two days

[218] two days later he landed on the french mainland at golfe juan and started heading north
[218] the 5th regiment was sent to intercept him and made contact just south of grenoble on 7 march 1815
"napoleon approached the regiment alone dismounted his horse and when he was within gunshot range shouted to the soldiers ""here i am"
kill your emperor if you wish
"""[219] the soldiers quickly responded with ""vive l'empereur """
ney who had boasted to the restored bourbon king louis xvii that he would bring napoleon to paris in an iron cage affectionately kissed his former emperor and forgot his oath of allegiance to the bourbon monarch
the two then marched together toward paris with a growing army
the unpopular louis xvii fled to belgium after realizing that he had little political support
on 13 march the powers at the congress of vienna declared napoleon an outlaw
four days later great britain russia austria and prussia each pledged to put 150 00 men into the field to end his rule
[220] napoleon arrived in paris on 20 march and governed for a period now called the hundred days
by the start of june the armed forces available to him had reached 200 00 and he decided to go on the offensive to attempt to drive a wedge between the oncoming british and prussian armies
the french army of the north crossed the frontier into the united kingdom of the netherlands in modern day belgium
[221] napoleon's forces fought two coalition armies commanded by the british duke of wellington and the prussian prince blücher at the battle of waterloo on 18 june 1815
wellington's army withstood repeated attacks by the french and drove them from the field while the prussians arrived in force and broke through napoleon's right flank
napoleon returned to paris and found that both the legislature and the people had turned against him
realizing that his position was untenable he abdicated on 22 june in favour of his son
he left paris three days later and settled at josephine's former palace in malmaison (on the western bank of the seine about 17 kilometres (11 mi) west of paris)
even as napoleon travelled to paris the coalition forces swept through france (arriving in the vicinity of paris on 29 june) with the stated intent of restoring louis xvii to the french throne
when napoleon heard that prussian troops had orders to capture him dead or alive he fled to rochefort considering an escape to the united states
british ships were blocking every port
napoleon surrendered to captain frederick maitland on hms bellerophon on 15 july 1815
[22] exile on saint helena napoleon on saint helena watercolor by franz josef sandmann c 1820 longwood house saint helena site of napoleon's captivity refusing napoleon's request for political asylum in england the british kept napoleon on the island of saint helena in the atlantic ocean 1 870 km (1 162 mi) from the west coast of africa
napoleon arrived at jamestown saint helena in october 1815 on board the hms northumberland
the british also took the precaution of sending a small garrison of soldiers to both saint helena and the nearby uninhabited ascension island which lay between st helena and europe to prevent any escape from the island
[223] napoleon stayed for two months at briars pavilion before he was moved to longwood house a large wooden bungalow on saint helena in december 1815
by this point the house had fallen into disrepair
the location and interior of the house was damp windswept and unhealthy
[224][225] the times published articles insinuating the british government was trying to hasten his death
"napoleon often complained of the living conditions of longwood house in letters to the island's governor and his custodian hudson lowe [226] while his attendants complained of ""colds catarrhs damp floors and poor provisions"
"""[227] modern scientists have speculated that his later illness may have arisen from arsenic poisoning caused by copper arsenite in the wallpaper at longwood house"
[228] with a small cadre of followers napoleon dictated his memoirs and grumbled about the living conditions
lowe cut napoleon's expenditure ruled that no gifts were allowed if they mentioned his imperial status and made his supporters sign a guarantee they would stay with the prisoner indefinitely
"[229] when he held a dinner party men were expected to wear military dress and ""women [appeared] in evening gowns and gems"
"it was an explicit denial of the circumstances of his captivity"""
[230] while in exile napoleon wrote a book about julius caesar one of his great heroes
[231] he also studied english under the tutelage of count emmanuel de las cases with the main aim of being able to read english newspapers and books as access to french newspapers and books was heavily restricted to him on saint helena
"[232] napoleon also devoted himself to compiling a book ""mémorial de ste hélène"" an account which reflected his self depiction as a liberal visionary ruler for european unification deposed by reactionary elements of the ancien régime"
[233] another pastime of napoleon's while in exile was playing card games
[234][235] the number of patiences named in his honour seems to suggest that he was an avid player of the solitary game
napoleon at st helena is described as being a favourite of his [236] while napoleon's favourite (or st helena) is clearly a contender
other games with a napoleonic theme include napoleon's flank napoleon's shoulder napoleon's square and little napoleon patience
"however arnold argues that while napoleon played cards in exile the notion that he played numerous patience games is ""based on a misunderstanding"""
[234] there were rumours of plots and even of his escape from saint helena but in reality no serious attempts were ever made
[237] for english poet lord byron napoleon was the epitome of the romantic hero the persecuted lonely and flawed genius
[238] death see also death mask of napoleon retour des cendres and napoleon's tomb frederick marryat's sketch of napoleon's body on his deathbed napoleon's personal physician barry o'meara warned london that his declining state of health was mainly caused by the harsh treatment
during the last few years of his life napoleon confined himself for months on end in his damp mold infested and wretched habitation of longwood
years of isolation and loneliness took its toll on napoleon's mental health having his court continually reduced including the arrest of count emmanuel de las cases conditions which lord holland used to bring about a debate regarding the treatment of napoleon in captivity
[239] in february 1821 napoleon's health began to deteriorate rapidly and he reconciled with the catholic church
by march he had become confined to bed
napoleon died on 5 may 1821 at longwood house at age 51 after making his last confession extreme unction and viaticum in the presence of father ange vignali from his deathbed
"his last words were france l'armée tête d'armée joséphine (""france the army head of the army joséphine"")"
[240][241][233] shortly after his death an autopsy was conducted and françois carlo antommarchi the doctor conducting the autopsy cut off napoleon's penis
[28][page needed][242] napoleon's original death mask was created around 6 may although it is not clear which doctor created it
[i][244] napoleon's heart and intestines were removed and contained separately in two sealed vessels which were placed inside his coffin at his feet
in his will he had asked to be buried on the banks of the seine but the british governor said he should be buried on saint helena in the valley of the willows
[240] napoleon's tomb at les invalides in paris in 1840 louis philippe i obtained permission from the british government to return napoleon's remains to france
his casket was opened to confirm that it still contained the former emperor
despite being dead for nearly two decades napoleon had been very well preserved and not decomposed at all
on 15 december 1840 a state funeral was held
the horse drawn hearse proceeded from the arc de triomphe down the champs élysées across the place de la concorde to the esplanade des invalides and then to the cupola in st jérôme's chapel where it remained until the tomb designed by louis visconti was completed
napoleon's remains passing through jamestown saint helena on 13 october 1840 in 1861 napoleon's remains were entombed in a sarcophagus of red quartzite from russia (often mistaken for porphyry) in the crypt under the dome at les invalides
[245] cause of death situation of napoleon's body when his coffin was reopened on st helena by jules rigo 1840 the cause of napoleon's death has been debated
his physician françois carlo antommarchi led the autopsy which found the cause of death to be stomach cancer
antommarchi did not sign the official report
[246] napoleon's father had died of stomach cancer although this was apparently unknown at the time of the autopsy
[247] antommarchi found evidence of a stomach ulcer this was the most convenient explanation for the british who wanted to avoid criticism over their care of napoleon
[240] in 1955 the diaries of napoleon's valet louis marchand were published
his description of napoleon in the months before his death led sten forshufvud in a 1961 paper in nature to put forward other causes for his death including deliberate arsenic poisoning
[248] arsenic was used as a poison during the era because it was undetectable when administered over a long period
furthermore in a 1978 book with ben weider forshufvud noted that napoleon's body was found to be well preserved when moved in 1840
arsenic is a strong preservative and therefore this supported the poisoning hypothesis
forshufvud and weider observed that napoleon had attempted to quench abnormal thirst by drinking large amounts of orgeat syrup that contained cyanide compounds in the almonds used for flavouring
[248] they maintained that the potassium tartrate used in his treatment prevented his stomach from expelling these compounds and that his thirst was a symptom of the poison
their hypothesis was that the calomel given to napoleon became an overdose which killed him and left extensive tissue damage behind
[248] according to a 2007 article the type of arsenic found in napoleon's hair shafts was mineral the most toxic and according to toxicologist patrick kintz this supported the conclusion that he was murdered
[249] there have been modern studies that have supported the original autopsy finding
[249] in a 2008 study researchers analysed samples of napoleon's hair from throughout his life as well as samples from his family and other contemporaries
all samples had high levels of arsenic approximately 100 times higher than the current average
according to these researchers napoleon's body was already heavily contaminated with arsenic as a boy and the high arsenic concentration in his hair was not caused by intentional poisoning people were constantly exposed to arsenic from glues and dyes throughout their lives
[j] studies published in 2007 and 2008 dismissed evidence of arsenic poisoning suggesting peptic ulcer and gastric cancer as the cause of death
[251] religion further information napoleon and the catholic church reorganisation of the religious geography france is divided into 59 dioceses and 10 ecclesiastical provinces
napoleon was baptised in ajaccio on 21 july 1771
he was raised as a catholic but never developed much faith [252] though he recalled the day of his first communion in the catholic church to be the happiest day of his life
[253][254] as an adult napoleon was a deist believing in an absent and distant god
however he had a keen appreciation of the power of organized religion in social and political affairs and he paid a great deal of attention to bending it to his purposes
he noted the influence of catholicism's rituals and splendors
[252] napoleon had a civil marriage with joséphine de beauharnais without religious ceremony
napoleon was crowned emperor on 2 december 1804 at notre dame de paris in a ceremony presided over by pope pius vii
on the eve of the coronation ceremony and at the insistence of pope pius vii a private religious wedding ceremony of napoleon and joséphine was celebrated
cardinal fesch performed the wedding
[255] this marriage was annulled by tribunals under napoleon's control in january 1810
on 1 april 1810 napoleon married the austrian princess marie louise in a catholic ceremony
napoleon was excommunicated by the pope through the bull quum memoranda in 1809 but later reconciled with the catholic church before his death in 1821
"[256] while in exile in saint helena he is recorded to have said ""i know men and i tell you that jesus christ is not a man"
"""[257][258][259] he also defended muhammad (""a great man"") against voltaire's mahomet"
[260] concordat further information concordat of 1801 leaders of the catholic church taking the civil oath required by the concordat seeking national reconciliation between revolutionaries and catholics napoleon and pope pius vii signed the concordat of 1801 on 15 july 1801
it solidified the roman catholic church as the majority church of france and brought back most of its civil status
the hostility of devout catholics against the state had now largely been resolved
the concordat did not restore the vast church lands and endowments that had been seized during the revolution and sold off
as a part of the concordat napoleon presented another set of laws called the organic articles
[261][262] while the concordat restored much power to the papacy the balance of church–state relations had tilted firmly in napoleon's favour
he selected the bishops and supervised church finances
napoleon and the pope both found the concordat useful
similar arrangements were made with the church in territories controlled by napoleon especially italy and germany
[263] now napoleon could win favour with the catholics while also controlling rome in a political sense
"napoleon said in april 1801 ""skillful conquerors have not got entangled with priests"
"they can both contain them and use them"""
french children were issued a catechism that taught them to love and respect napoleon
[264] arrest of pope pius vii in 1809 under napoleon's orders pope pius vii was placed under arrest in italy and in 1812 the prisoner pontiff was transferred to france being held in the palace of fontainebleau
[265] because the arrest was made in a clandestine manner some sources[266][265][267] describe it as a kidnapping
"[268] in january 1813 napoleon personally forced the pope to sign a humiliating ""concordat of fontainebleau""[269] which was later repudiated by the pontiff"
[270] the pope was not released until 1814 when the coalition invaded france
religious emancipation further information napoleon and the jews and napoleon and protestants napoleon emancipated jews as well as protestants in catholic countries and catholics in protestant countries from laws which restricted them to ghettos and he expanded their rights to property worship and careers
despite the antisemitic reaction to napoleon's policies from foreign governments and within france he believed emancipation would benefit france by attracting jews to the country given the restrictions they faced elsewhere
[271] in 1806 an assembly of jewish notables was gathered by napoleon to discuss 12 questions broadly dealing with the relations between jews and christians as well as other issues dealing with the jewish ability to integrate into french society
"later after the questions were answered in a satisfactory way according to the emperor a ""great sanhedrin"" was brought together to transform the answers into decisions that would form the basis of the future status of the jews in france and the rest of the empire napoleon was building"
"[272] he stated ""i will never accept any proposals that will obligate the jewish people to leave france because to me the jews are the same as any other citizen in our country"
"it takes weakness to chase them out of the country but it takes strength to assimilate them"""
"[273] he was seen as so favourable to the jews that the russian orthodox church formally condemned him as ""antichrist and the enemy of god"""
[274] one year after the final meeting of the sanhedrin on 17 march 1808 napoleon placed the jews on probation
several new laws restricting the citizenship the jews had been offered 17 years previously were instituted at that time
however despite pressure from leaders of a number of christian communities to refrain from granting jews emancipation within one year of the issue of the new restrictions they were once again lifted in response to the appeal of jews from all over france
[272] freemasonry it is not known for certain if napoleon was initiated into freemasonry
as emperor he appointed his brothers to masonic offices under his jurisdiction louis was given the title of deputy grand master in 1805 jerome the title of grand master of the grand orient of westphalia joseph was appointed grand master of the grand orient de france and finally lucien was a member of the grand orient of france
[275] personality napoleon visiting the palais royal for the opening of the 8th session of the tribunat in 1807 by merry joseph blondel historians emphasize the strength of the ambition that took napoleon from an obscure village to rule over most of europe
"[276] in depth academic studies about his early life conclude that up until age 2 he had a ""gentle disposition"""
[29] his older brother joseph frequently received their mother's attention which made napoleon more assertive and approval driven
during his early schooling years he would be harshly bullied by classmates for his corsican identity and limited command of the french language
to withstand the stress he became domineering eventually developing an inferiority complex
"[29] george f e rudé stresses his ""rare combination of will intellect and physical vigour"""
[277] in one on one situations he typically had a hypnotic effect on people seemingly bending the strongest leaders to his will
[278] he understood military technology but was not an innovator in that regard
[279] he was an innovator in using the financial bureaucratic and diplomatic resources of france
"he could rapidly dictate a series of complex commands to his subordinates keeping in mind where major units were expected to be at each future point and like a chess master ""seeing"" the best plays moves ahead"
"[280] this intellectual vigour was accompanied by a mixture of ""remarkable charisma and willpower"" and ""a furious temper"" exhibited during failure of his plans which commanded respect as well as dread from his adjutants"
[281] napoleon maintained strict efficient work habits prioritizing what needed to be done
he cheated at cards but repaid the losses he had to win at everything he attempted
[282] he kept relays of staff and secretaries at work
unlike many generals napoleon did not examine history to ask what hannibal or alexander or anyone else did in a similar situation
"critics said he won many battles simply because of luck napoleon responded ""give me lucky generals"" arguing that ""luck"" comes to leaders who recognize opportunity and seize it"
[283] dwyer states that napoleon's victories at austerlitz and jena in 1805–06 heightened his sense of self grandiosity leaving him even more certain of his destiny and invincibility
"[284] ""i am of the race that founds empires"" he once boasted deeming himself an heir to the ancient romans"
[285] in terms of influence on events it was more than napoleon's personality that took effect
he reorganized france itself to supply the men and money needed for wars
[286] he inspired his men—the duke of wellington said his presence on the battlefield was worth 40 00 soldiers for he inspired confidence from privates to field marshals
[287] the force of his personality neutralized material difficulties as his soldiers fought with the confidence that with napoleon in charge they would surely win
[288] image further information cultural depictions of napoleon napoleon is often represented in his green colonel uniform of the chasseur à cheval of the imperial guard the regiment that often served as his personal escort with a large bicorne and a hand in waistcoat gesture
"the military historian martin van creveld has described him as ""the most competent human being who ever lived"""
[289] since his death many towns streets ships and even cartoon characters have been named after him
he has been portrayed in hundreds of films and discussed in hundreds of thousands of books and articles
"[290][291][292] the german legal scholar carl theoder welcker described napoleon as ""the greatest master of machiavellism"""
[293] when his contemporaries met him in person many were surprised by his apparently unremarkable physical appearance in contrast to his significant deeds and reputation especially in his youth when he was consistently described as small and thin
"english painter joseph farington who observed napoleon personally in 1802 commented that ""samuel rogers stood a little way from me and seemed to be disappointed in the look of [napoleon's] countenance [""face""] and said it was that of a little italian """
"farington said napoleon's eyes were ""lighter and more of a grey than i should have expected from his complexion"" that ""his person is below middle size"" and that ""his general aspect was milder than i had before thought it"
"""[294] a personal friend of napoleon's said that when he first met him in brienne le château as a young man napoleon was only notable ""for the dark color of his complexion for his piercing and scrutinising glance and for the style of his conversation"" he also said that napoleon was personally a serious and somber man ""his conversation bore the appearance of ill humor and he was certainly not very amiable"
"""[295] johann ludwig wurstemberger who accompanied napoleon from camp fornio in 1797 and on the swiss campaign of 1798 noted that ""bonaparte was rather slight and emaciated looking his face too was very thin with a dark complexion his black unpowdered hair hung down evenly over both shoulders"" but that despite his slight and unkempt appearance ""[h]is looks and expression were earnest and powerful"
"""[296] denis davydov met him personally and considered him remarkably average in appearance his face was slightly swarthy with regular features"
his nose was not very large but straight with a slight hardly noticeable bend
the hair on his head was dark reddish blond his eyebrows and eyelashes were much darker than the colour of his hair and his blue eyes set off by the almost black lashes gave him a most pleasing expression
the man i saw was of short stature just over five feet tall rather heavy although he was only 37 years old
[297] during the napoleonic wars he was taken seriously by the british press as a dangerous tyrant poised to invade
"despite or due to his average size napoleon was mocked in british newspapers as a short tempered small man and he was nicknamed ""little boney in a strong fit"""
"[298] a nursery rhyme warned children that bonaparte ravenously ate naughty people the ""bogeyman"""
"[299] the british propaganda about his supposedly small size was so successful that many people today ""know"" very little besides this untruth about him"
[300] at 1 57 metres (5 ft 2 in) he had the height of an average french male but was short for an aristocrat or officer (partly why he was assigned to the artillery since at the time the infantry and cavalry required more commanding figures)
[301] some historians believe his size at death was incorrectly recorded due to use of an obsolete old french yardstick (a french foot equals 33 cm while an english foot equals 30 47 cm)
[301][302] but napoleon was a champion of the metric system and had no use for the old yardsticks that had been out of use since 1793 in france
it is likely that he was 1 57 m (5 ft 2 in) the height measured on st helena (a british island) since he would have most likely been measured with an english yardstick rather than a yardstick of the french old regime
[301] napoleon surrounded himself with tall bodyguards and was affectionately nicknamed le petit caporal (the little corporal) reflecting his reported camaraderie with his soldiers rather than his height
when he became first consul and later emperor napoleon eschewed his general's uniform and habitually wore the green colonel uniform (non hussar) of a colonel of the chasseur à cheval of the imperial guard the regiment that served as his personal escort many times with a large bicorne
he also habitually wore (usually on sundays) the blue uniform of a colonel of the imperial guard foot grenadiers (blue with white facings and red cuffs)
he also wore his légion d'honneur star medal and ribbon and the order of the iron crown decorations white french style culottes and white stockings
this was in contrast to the complex uniforms with many decorations of his marshals and those around him
in his later years he gained quite a bit of weight and had a complexion considered pale or sallow something contemporaries took note of
"novelist paul de kock who saw him in 1811 on the balcony of the tuileries called napoleon ""yellow obese and bloated"""
"[303] a british captain who met him in 1815 stated ""i felt very much disappointed as i believe everyone else did in his appearance"
he is fat rather what we call pot bellied and although his leg is well shaped it is rather clumsy
he is very sallow with light grey eyes and rather thin greasy looking brown hair and altogether a very nasty priestlike looking fellow
"""[304] the stock character of napoleon is a comically short ""petty tyrant"" and this has become a cliché in popular culture"
he is often portrayed wearing a large bicorne hat—sideways—with a hand in waistcoat gesture—a reference to the painting produced in 1812 by jacques louis david
[305] in 1908 alfred adler a psychologist cited napoleon to describe an inferiority complex in which short people adopt an over aggressive behaviour to compensate for lack of height this inspired the term napoleon complex
[306] reforms first remittance of the légion d'honneur 15 july 1804 at saint louis des invalides by jean baptiste debret (1812) napoleon instituted various reforms such as higher education a tax code road and sewer systems and established the banque de france the first central bank in french history
he negotiated the concordat of 1801 with the catholic church which sought to reconcile the mostly catholic population to his regime
it was presented alongside the organic articles which regulated public worship in france
he dissolved the holy roman empire prior to german unification later in the 19th century
the sale of the louisiana territory to the united states doubled the size of the united states
[307] in may 1802 he instituted the legion of honour a substitute for the old royalist decorations and orders of chivalry to encourage civilian and military achievements the order is still the highest decoration in france
[308] napoleonic code main article napoleonic code first page of the 1804 original edition of the code civil napoleon's set of civil laws the code civil—now often known as the napoleonic code—was prepared by committees of legal experts under the supervision of jean jacques régis de cambacérès the second consul
napoleon participated actively in the sessions of the council of state that revised the drafts
the development of the code was a fundamental change in the nature of the civil law legal system with its stress on clearly written and accessible law
"other codes (""les cinq codes"") were commissioned by napoleon to codify criminal and commerce law a code of criminal instruction was published which enacted rules of due process"
[309] the napoleonic code was adopted throughout much of continental europe though only in the lands he conquered and remained in force after napoleon's defeat
"napoleon said ""my true glory is not to have won forty battles waterloo will erase the memory of so many victories"
"but what will live forever is my civil code"""
[310] the code influences a quarter of the world's jurisdictions such as those in continental europe the americas and africa
"[311] dieter langewiesche described the code as a ""revolutionary project"" that spurred the development of bourgeois society in germany by the extension of the right to own property and an acceleration towards the end of feudalism"
napoleon reorganized what had been the holy roman empire made up of about three hundred kleinstaaterei into a more streamlined forty state confederation of the rhine this helped promote the german confederation and the unification of germany in 1871
[312] the movement toward italian unification was similarly precipitated by napoleonic rule
[313] these changes contributed to the development of nationalism and the nation state
[314] napoleon directly overthrew remnants of feudalism in much of western continental europe
he liberalized property laws ended seigneurial dues abolished the guild of merchants and craftsmen to facilitate entrepreneurship legalized divorce closed the jewish ghettos and made jews equal to everyone else
the inquisition ended as did the holy roman empire
the power of church courts and religious authority was sharply reduced and equality under the law was proclaimed for all men
[315] warfare further information napoleonic weaponry and warfare and military career of napoleon bonaparte statue in cherbourg octeville unveiled by napoleon ii in 1858
napoleon i strengthened the town's defences to prevent british naval incursions
in the field of military organization napoleon borrowed from previous theorists such as jacques antoine hippolyte comte de guibert and from the reforms of preceding french governments and then developed much of what was already in place
he continued the policy which emerged from the revolution of promotion based primarily on merit
[316] corps replaced divisions as the largest army units mobile artillery was integrated into reserve batteries the staff system became more fluid and cavalry returned as an important formation in french military doctrine
these methods are now referred to as essential features of napoleonic warfare
[316] though he consolidated the practice of modern conscription introduced by the directory one of the restored monarchy's first acts was to end it
[317] his opponents learned from napoleon's innovations
the increased importance of artillery after 1807 stemmed from his creation of a highly mobile artillery force the growth in artillery numbers and changes in artillery practices
as a result of these factors napoleon rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defences now could use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line that was then exploited by supporting infantry and cavalry
mcconachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the french army beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the french infantry and later france's inferiority in cavalry numbers
[318] weapons and other kinds of military technology remained static through the revolutionary and napoleonic eras but 18th century operational mobility underwent change
[319] napoleon's biggest influence was in the conduct of warfare
antoine henri jomini explained napoleon's methods in a widely used textbook that influenced all european and american armies
[320] napoleon was regarded by the influential military theorist carl von clausewitz as a genius in the operational art of war and historians rank him as a great military commander
"[321] wellington when asked who was the greatest general of the day answered ""in this age in past ages in any age napoleon"""
[322][incomplete short citation] under napoleon a new emphasis towards the destruction not just outmaneuvering of enemy armies emerged
invasions of enemy territory occurred over broader fronts which made wars costlier and more decisive
the political effect of war increased defeat for a european power meant more than the loss of isolated enclaves
near carthaginian peaces intertwined whole national efforts intensifying the revolutionary phenomenon of total war
[323] metric system main articles history of the metric system mesures usuelles and units of measurement in france depicted as first consul on the 1803 20 gold napoléon gold coin the official introduction of the metric system in september 1799 was unpopular in large sections of french society
napoleon's rule greatly aided adoption of the new standard not only across france but also across the french sphere of influence
napoleon took a retrograde step in 1812 when he passed legislation to introduce the mesures usuelles (traditional units of measurement) for retail trade [324] a system of measure that resembled the pre revolutionary units but were based on the kilogram and the metre for example the livre metrique (metric pound) was 500 g [325] in contrast to the value of the livre du roi (the king's pound) 489 5 g [326] other units of measure were rounded in a similar manner prior to the definitive introduction of the metric system across parts of europe in the middle of the 19th century
[327] education napoleon's educational reforms laid the foundation of a modern system of education in france and throughout much of europe
[328] napoleon synthesized the best academic elements from the ancien régime the enlightenment and the revolution with the aim of establishing a stable well educated and prosperous society
he made french the only official language
he left some primary education in the hands of religious orders but he offered public support to secondary education
napoleon founded a number of state secondary schools (lycées) designed to produce a standardized education that was uniform across france
[329] all students were taught the sciences along with modern and classical languages
unlike the system during the ancien régime religious topics did not dominate the curriculum although they were present with the teachers from the clergy
napoleon hoped to use religion to produce social stability
[329] he gave special attention to the advanced centers such as the école polytechnique that provided both military expertise and state of the art research in science
[330] napoleon made some of the first efforts at establishing a system of secular and public education [when ]
the system featured scholarships and strict discipline with the result being a french educational system that outperformed its european counterparts many of which borrowed from the french system
"[331] memory and evaluation main article legacy and memory of napoleon criticism the third of may 1808 by francisco goya showing spanish resisters being executed by french troops a mass grave of soldiers killed at the battle of waterloo in the political realm historians debate whether napoleon was ""an enlightened despot who laid the foundations of modern europe"" or ""a megalomaniac who wrought greater misery than any man before the coming of hitler"""
[332] many historians have concluded that he had grandiose foreign policy ambitions
the continental powers as late as 1808 were willing to give him nearly all of his gains and titles but some scholars maintain he was overly aggressive and pushed for too much until his empire collapsed
[33][334] he was considered a tyrant and usurper by his opponents at the time and ever since
his critics charge that he was not troubled when faced with the prospect of war and death for thousands turned his search for undisputed rule into a series of conflicts throughout europe and ignored treaties and conventions alike
[335] his role in the haitian revolution and decision to reinstate slavery in france's overseas colonies are controversial and affect his reputation
"[336] french liberal intellectual benjamin constant (1767–1830) was a staunch critic of political homogenisation and personality cult that dominated napoleonic france and wrote several books condemning napoleon such as ""the spirit of conquest and usurpation"" (1814) and ""principles of politics applicable to all representative governments"" (1815)"
according to constant bonapartism was even more tyrannical than the bourbon monarchy since it forced the masses to support its grand universalist narrative through imperialism and jingoism
[337] napoleon institutionalized plunder of conquered territories french museums contain art stolen by napoleon's forces from across europe
artefacts were brought to the musée du louvre for a grand central museum an example which would later be followed by others
[338] he was compared to adolf hitler by the historian pieter geyl in 1947 [339] and claude ribbe in 2005
"[340] david g chandler a historian of napoleonic warfare wrote in 1973 that ""nothing could be more degrading to the former [napoleon] and more flattering to the latter [hitler]"
the comparison is odious
on the whole napoleon was inspired by a noble dream wholly dissimilar from hitler's napoleon left great and lasting testimonies to his genius—in codes of law and national identities which survive to the present day
adolf hitler left nothing but destruction
"""[341] critics argue napoleon's true legacy must reflect the loss of status for france and needless deaths brought by his rule historian victor davis hanson writes ""after all the military record is unquestioned—17 years of wars perhaps six million europeans dead france bankrupt her overseas colonies lost"
"""[342] mclynn states that ""he can be viewed as the man who set back european economic life for a generation by the dislocating impact of his wars"
"""[335] vincent cronin replies that such criticism relies on the flawed premise that napoleon was responsible for the wars which bear his name when in fact france was the victim of a series of coalitions that aimed to destroy the ideals of the revolution"
"[343] british military historian correlli barnett calls him ""a social misfit"" who exploited france for his personal megalomaniac goals"
he says napoleon's reputation is exaggerated
[344] french scholar jean tulard provided an influential account of his image as a saviour
[345] louis bergeron has praised the numerous changes he made to french society especially regarding the law as well as education
[346] his greatest failure was the russian invasion
many historians have blamed napoleon's poor planning but russian scholars instead emphasize the russian response noting the notorious winter weather was just as hard on the defenders
[347] the large and growing historiography in french english russian spanish and other languages has been summarized and evaluated by numerous scholars
[348][349][350] propaganda and memory 1814 caricature of napoleon being exiled to elba the ex emperor is riding a donkey backwards while holding a broken sword
main article napoleonic propaganda napoleon's use of propaganda contributed to his rise to power legitimated his régime and established his image for posterity
strict censorship controlling various key constituents of the press books theatre and art were part of his propaganda scheme aimed at portraying him as bringing desperately wanted peace and stability to france
the propagandistic rhetoric changed in relation to events and to the atmosphere of napoleon's reign focusing first on his role as a general in the army and identification as a soldier and moving to his role as emperor and a civil leader
specifically targeting his civilian audience napoleon fostered a relationship with the contemporary art community taking an active role in commissioning and controlling different forms of art production to suit his propaganda goals

(musée de la révolution française)
in england russia and across europe—though not in france—napoleon was a popular topic of caricature
[352][353][354] hazareesingh (2004) explores how napoleon's image and memory are best understood
they played a key role in collective political defiance of the bourbon restoration monarchy in 1815–1830
people from different walks of life and areas of france particularly napoleonic veterans drew on the napoleonic legacy and its connections with the ideals of the 1789 revolution
[355] widespread rumours of napoleon's return from st helena and napoleon as an inspiration for patriotism individual and collective liberties and political mobilization manifested themselves in seditious materials displaying the tricolor and rosettes
there were also subversive activities celebrating anniversaries of napoleon's life and reign and disrupting royal celebrations—they demonstrated the prevailing and successful goal of the varied supporters of napoleon to constantly destabilize the bourbon regime
[355] datta (2005) shows that following the collapse of militaristic boulangism in the late 1880s the napoleonic legend was divorced from party politics and revived in popular culture
concentrating on two plays and two novels from the period—victorien sardou's madame sans gêne (1893) maurice barrès's les déracinés (1897) edmond rostand's l'aiglon (1900) and andré de lorde and gyp's napoléonette (1913)—datta examines how writers and critics of the belle époque exploited the napoleonic legend for diverse political and cultural ends
[356] reduced to a minor character the new fictional napoleon became not a world historical figure but an intimate one fashioned by individuals' needs and consumed as popular entertainment
in their attempts to represent the emperor as a figure of national unity proponents and detractors of the third republic used the legend as a vehicle for exploring anxieties about gender and fears about the processes of democratization that accompanied this new era of mass politics and culture
[356] international napoleonic congresses take place regularly with participation by members of the french and american military french politicians and scholars from different countries
[357] in january 2012 the mayor of montereau fault yonne near paris—the site of a late victory of napoleon—proposed development of napoleon's bivouac a commemorative theme park at a projected cost of 200 million euros

long term influence outside france main article influence of the french revolution bas relief of napoleon in the chamber of the united states house of representatives napoleon was responsible for spreading the values of the french revolution to other countries especially in legal reform
[359] after the fall of napoleon not only was it retained by conquered countries including the netherlands belgium parts of italy and germany but it has been used as the basis of certain parts of law outside europe including the dominican republic the us state of louisiana and the canadian province of quebec
[360] the code was also used as a model in many parts of latin america
[361] the reputation of napoleon in poland has been favourable especially for his support of independence opposition to russia his legal code the abolition of serfdom and the introduction of modern middle class administration
[362] napoleon had an influence on the establishment of modern germany
he caused the end of the holy roman empire and helped create middle sized states such as bavaria and württemberg along the great powers prussia and austria
although he also directly or indirectly helped to reduce the number of german states (from about 300 to fewer than 50) the middle sized states tried to prevent the unification of germany as a federalist state
a byproduct of the french occupation was a strong development in german nationalism which eventually turned the german confederation into the german empire after a series of conflicts and other political developments
napoleon indirectly began the process of latin american independence when he invaded spain in 1808
the abdication of king charles iv and renunciation of his son ferdinand vii created a power vacuum that was filled by native born political leaders such as simón bolívar and josé de san martín
such leaders embraced nationalistic sentiments influenced by french nationalism and led successful independence movements in latin america
[363] napoleon also significantly aided the united states when he agreed to sell the territory of louisiana for 15 million dollars during the presidency of thomas jefferson
that territory almost doubled the size of the united states adding the equivalent of 13 states to the union
[307] from 1796 to 2020 at least 95 major ships were named for him
in the 21st century at least 18 napoleon ships are operated under the flag of france as well as indonesia germany italy australia argentina india netherlands and the united kingdom
[364] by wanting to make his dynasty the most ancient in europe napoleon ousted numerous houses in favor of his own family
talleyrand commented that “either these newly created sovereigns respected his overarching plan and became its satellites which made it impossible for them to take root in the country entrusted to them or they must reject it
… each new creation thus became a source of dissolution in napoleon’s fortune ” [365] wives mistresses and children joséphine first wife of napoleon obtained the civil dissolution of her marriage under the napoleonic code
painting by henri frédéric schopin 1843
marriage of napoleon and marie louise by georges rouget 1843 napoleon married joséphine (née marie josèphe rose tascher de la pagerie) in 1796 when he was 26 she was a 32 year old widow whose first husband alexandre de beauharnais had been executed during the reign of terror
five days after alexandre de beauharnais' death the reign of terror initiator maximilien de robespierre was overthrown and executed and with the help of high placed friends joséphine was freed
"[366] until she met bonaparte she had been known as ""rose"" a name which he disliked"
"he called her ""joséphine"" instead and she went by this name henceforth"
bonaparte often sent her love letters while on his campaigns
[367] he formally adopted her son eugène and second cousin (via marriage) stéphanie and arranged dynastic marriages for them
joséphine had her daughter hortense marry napoleon's brother louis
[368] joséphine had lovers such as lieutenant hippolyte charles during napoleon's italian campaign
[369] napoleon learnt of that affair and a letter he wrote about it was intercepted by the british and published widely to embarrass napoleon
napoleon had his own affairs too during the egyptian campaign he took pauline bellisle fourès the wife of a junior officer as his mistress
"she became known as ""cleopatra"""
[k][371] while napoleon's mistresses had children by him joséphine did not produce an heir possibly because of either the stresses of her imprisonment during the reign of terror or an abortion she may have had in her twenties
[372] napoleon chose divorce so he could remarry in search of an heir
despite his divorce from josephine napoleon showed his dedication to her for the rest of his life
when he heard the news of her death while in exile in elba he locked himself in his room and would not come out for two full days
[217] her name would also be his final word on his deathbed in 1821
on 11 march 1810 by proxy he married the 19 year old marie louise archduchess of austria and a great niece of marie antoinette
thus he had married into a german royal and imperial family
"[373] louise was less than happy with the arrangement at least at first stating ""just to see the man would be the worst form of torture"""
her great aunt had been executed in france while napoleon had fought numerous campaigns against austria all throughout his military career
however she seemed to warm up to him over time
"after her wedding she wrote to her father ""he loves me very much"
i respond to his love sincerely
"there is something very fetching and very eager about him that is impossible to resist"""
[217] napoleon and marie louise remained married until his death though she did not join him in exile on elba and thereafter never saw her husband again
the couple had one child napoleon francis joseph charles (1811–1832) known from birth as the king of rome
he became napoleon ii in 1814 and reigned for only two weeks
he was awarded the title of the duke of reichstadt in 1818 and died of tuberculosis aged 21 with no children
[373] napoleon acknowledged one illegitimate son charles léon (1806–1881) by eléonore denuelle de la plaigne
[374] alexandre colonna walewski (1810–1868) the son of his mistress maria walewska although acknowledged by walewska's husband was also widely known to be his child and the dna of his direct male descendant has been used to help confirm napoleon's y chromosome haplotype
[375] he may have had further unacknowledged illegitimate offspring as well such as eugen megerle von mühlfeld by emilie victoria kraus von wolfsberg[376] and hélène napoleone bonaparte (1816–1907) by albine de montholon
