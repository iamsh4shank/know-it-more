kangaroo kangaroo a kangaroo is a marsupial from the family macropodidae (macropods meaning 'large foot')
kangaroo in common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family the red kangaroo the antilopine kangaroo and the eastern and western grey kangaroo of the macropus genus
kangaroo the family also includes many smaller species which include the wallabies tree kangaroos wallaroos pademelons and the quokka some 63 living species in all
kangaroo kangaroos are endemic to the continent of australia while the smaller macropods are found in australia and new guinea
kangaroo in general larger kangaroos have adapted much better to changes wrought to the australian landscape by humans and though many of their smaller cousins are endangered they are plentiful
kangaroo they are not farmed to any extent but wild kangaroos are shot for meat over which there is controversy

kangaroo there are four species that are commonly referred to as kangaroos * the red kangaroo (macropus rufus) is the largest surviving marsupial anywhere in the world
kangaroo fewer in numbers the red kangaroo occupies the arid and semi arid centre of the continent
kangaroo a large male can be 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 90 kg (200 lb)
kangaroo * the eastern grey kangaroo (macropus giganteus) is less well known than the red (outside of australia) but the most often seen as its range covers the fertile eastern part of the continent
kangaroo * the western grey kangaroo (macropus fuliginosus) is slightly smaller again at about 54 kg (119 lb) for a large male
kangaroo it is found in the southern part of western australia south australia near the coast and the darling river basin
kangaroo * the antilopine kangaroo (macropus antilopinus) is essentially the far northern equivalent of the eastern and western grey kangaroos
kangaroo like them it is a creature of the grassy plains and woodlands and gregarious
kangaroo in addition there are about 50 smaller macropods closely related to the kangaroo in the family macropodidae
kangaroo red kangaroo (macropus rufus) europeans have long regarded kangaroos as strange animals
kangaroo early explorers described them as creatures that had heads like deer (without antlers) stood upright like men and hopped like frogs
kangaroo combined with the two headed appearance of a mother kangaroo this led many back home to dismiss them as travellers' tales for quite some time
kangaroo kangaroos have large powerful hind legs large feet adapted for leaping a long muscular tail for balance and a small head
kangaroo like all marsupials female kangaroos have a pouch called a marsupium in which joeys complete postnatal development
kangaroo kangaroos are the only large animals to use hopping as a means of locomotion
kangaroo the comfortable hopping speed for red kangaroo is about 20 25 km/h (13 16 mph) but speeds of up to 70 km/h (44 mph) can be attained over short distances while it can sustain a speed of 40 km/h (25 mph) for nearly two kilometres
kangaroo this fast and energy efficient method of travel has evolved because of the need to regularly cover large distances in search of food and water rather than the need to escape predators
kangaroo because of its long feet it cannot walk correctly
kangaroo to move at slow speeds it uses its tail to form a tripod with its two forelimbs
"kangaroo it then raises its hind feet forward in a form of locomotion called ""crawl walking """
kangaroo the average life expectancy of a kangaroo is about 4 6 years
kangaroo different species of kangaroos eat different diets
kangaroo eastern grey kangaroos are predominantly grazers eating a wide variety of grasses whereas some other species (e g
kangaroo red kangaroos and swamp wallabies) include significant amounts of shrubs in the diet
kangaroo the smaller species of kangaroos also consume hypogeal fungi
kangaroo many species are nocturnal archives url accessed january 7 2007 and crepuscular columbus zoo article url accessed january 7 2007 usually spending the days resting in shade and the cool evenings nights and mornings moving about and feeding
kangaroo because of its grazing kangaroos have developed specialized teeth
kangaroo its incisors are able to crop grass close to the ground and its molars chop and grind the grass
kangaroo since the two sides of the lower jaw are not joined together the lower incisors are farther apart giving the kangaroo a wider bite
kangaroo the silica in grass is abrasive so kangaroo molars move forward as they are ground down and eventually fall out replaced by new teeth that grow in the back
kangaroo despite having a herbivorous diet similar to ruminants such as cattle which release large quantities of methane through exhaling and eructation kangaroos release virtually none
kangaroo the hydrogen byproduct of fermentation is instead converted into acetate which is then used to provide further energy
kangaroo scientists are interested in the possibility of transferring the bacteria responsible from kangaroos to cattle since the greenhouse gas effect of methane is 23 times greater than that of carbon dioxide

kangaroo kangaroos have few natural predators
kangaroo the thylacine considered by palaeontologists to have once been a major natural predator of the kangaroo is now extinct
kangaroo other extinct predators included the marsupial lion megalania and the wonambi
kangaroo however with the arrival of humans in australia at least 50 00 years ago and the introduction of the dingo about 5 00 years ago kangaroos have had to adapt
kangaroo the mere barking of a dog can set a full grown male boomer into a wild frenzy
kangaroo wedge tailed eagles and other raptors usually eat kangaroo carrion
kangaroo goannas and other carnivorous reptiles also pose a danger to smaller kangaroo species when other food sources are lacking
kangaroo along with dingos and other canids introduced species like foxes and feral cats also pose a threat to kangaroo populations
kangaroo kangaroos and wallabies are adept swimmers and often flee into waterways if presented with the option
kangaroo if pursued into the water a large kangaroo may use its forepaws to hold the predator underwater so as to drown it

kangaroo another defensive tactic described by witnesses is catching the attacking dog with the forepaws and disembowelling it with the hind legs
kangaroo newborn joey sucking on a teat in the pouch kangaroos have developed a number of adaptations to a dry infertile continent and highly variable climate
kangaroo as with all marsupials the young are born at a very early stage of development after a gestation of 31 36 days
kangaroo at this stage only the forelimbs are somewhat developed to allow the newborn to climb to the pouch and attach to a teat
kangaroo in comparison a human embryo at a similar stage of development would be about seven weeks old and premature babies born at less than 23 weeks are usually not mature enough to survive
kangaroo the joey will usually stay in the pouch for about nine months (180 320 days for the western grey) before starting to leave the pouch for small periods of time
kangaroo it is usually fed by its mother until reaching 18 months
kangaroo the female kangaroo is usually pregnant in permanence except on the day she gives birth however she has the ability to freeze the development of an embryo until the previous joey is able to leave the pouch
kangaroo this is known as diapause and will occur in times of drought and in areas with poor food sources
kangaroo the composition of the milk produced by the mother varies according to the needs of the joey
kangaroo in addition the mother is able to produce two different kinds of milk simultaneously for the newborn and the older joey still in the pouch
kangaroo unusually during a dry period males will not produce sperm and females will only conceive if there has been enough rain to produce a large quantity of green vegetation
kangaroo hindleg of a kangaroo kangaroos and wallabies have large stretchy tendons in their hind legs
kangaroo they store elastic strain energy in the tendons of their large hind legs providing most of the energy required for each hop by the spring action of the tendons rather than by any muscular effort
kangaroo this is true in all animal species which have muscles connected to their skeleton through elastic elements such as tendons but the effect is more pronounced in kangaroos
kangaroo there is also a link between the hopping action and breathing as the feet leave the ground air is expelled from the lungs bringing the feet forward ready for landing refills the lungs providing further energy efficiency
kangaroo studies of kangaroos and wallabies have demonstrated that beyond the minimum energy expenditure required to hop at all increased speed requires very little extra effort (much less than the same speed increase in say a horse dog or human) and that the extra energy is required to carry extra weight
kangaroo for kangaroos the key benefit of hopping is not speed to escape predators the top speed of a kangaroo is no higher than that of a similarly sized quadruped and the australian native predators are in any case less fearsome than those of other continents but economy in an infertile continent with highly variable weather patterns the ability of a kangaroo to travel long distances at moderately high speed in search of food sources is crucial to survival
kangaroo a sequencing project of the kangaroo genome was started in 2004 as a collaboration between australia (mainly funded by the state of victoria) and the national institutes of health in the us

kangaroo the genome of a marsupial such as the kangaroo is of great interest to scientists studying comparative genomics because marsupials are at an ideal degree of evolutionary divergence from humans mice are too close and haven't developed many different functions while birds are genetically too remote
kangaroo the dairy industry has also expressed some interest in this project
kangaroo eye disease is rare but not new among kangaroos
kangaroo the first official report of kangaroo blindness took place in 1994 in central new south wales
kangaroo the following year reports of blind kangaroos appeared in victoria and south australia
"kangaroo by 1996 the disease had spread ""across the desert to western australia"""
kangaroo australian authorities were concerned that the disease could spread to other livestock and possibly humans
kangaroo researchers at the australian animal health laboratories in geelong detected a virus called the wallal virus in two species of midge believed to have been the carriers
kangaroo veterinarians also discovered that less than three percent of kangaroos exposed to the virus developed blindness
kangaroo before european settlement the kangaroo was a very important animal for australian aborigines for its meat hide bones and sinews
kangaroo in addition there were important dreaming stories and ceremonies involving the kangaroo
kangaroo aherrenge is a current kangaroo dreaming site in the northern territory
kangaroo the game of marn grook was played using a ball made from kangaroo by the kurnai people
kangaroo unlike many of the smaller macropods kangaroos have fared well since european settlement
kangaroo european settlers cut down forests to create vast grasslands for sheep and cattle grazing added stock watering points in arid areas and have substantially reduced the number of dingoes
kangaroo kangaroos are shy and retiring by nature and in normal circumstances present no threat to humans

kangaroo there are very few records of kangaroos attacking humans without provocation however several such unprovoked attacks in 2004 spurred fears of a rabies like disease possibly affecting the marsupials

kangaroo a collision with a vehicle is capable of killing a kangaroo
kangaroo kangaroos dazzled by headlights or startled by engine noise have been known to leap in front of cars
kangaroo since kangaroos in mid bound can reach speeds of around 50 km/h (31 mph) and are relatively heavy the force of impact can be severe
kangaroo small vehicles may be destroyed while larger vehicles may suffer engine damage
kangaroo the risk of harm to vehicle occupants is greatly increased if the windscreen is the point of impact
"kangaroo as a result ""kangaroo crossing"" signs are commonplace in australia"
"kangaroo vehicles that frequent isolated roads where roadside assistance may be scarce are often fitted with ""roo bars"" to minimise damage caused by collision"
kangaroo bonnet mounted devices designed to scare wildlife off the road with ultrasound and other methods have been devised and marketed
kangaroo if a female is the victim of a collision animal welfare groups ask that her pouch be checked for any surviving joey in which case it may be removed to a wildlife sanctuary or veterinary surgeon for rehabilitation
kangaroo likewise when an adult kangaroo is injured in a collision a vet the rspca or the national parks and wildlife service can be consulted for instructions on proper care
kangaroo in new south wales rehabilitation of kangaroos is carried out by volunteers from wires
kangaroo occasionally individuals take on the task of rearing a recovered joey themselves
kangaroo the rule of thumb says that if the joey is already covered with fur at the time of the accident (as opposed to still being in its embryonic stage) it stands a good chance of growing up properly
kangaroo lactose free milk is required otherwise the animal may develop blindness
kangaroo they hop readily into a cloth bag when it is lowered in front of them approximately to the height where the mother's pouch would be
"kangaroo the joey's instinct is to ""cuddle up"" thereby endearing themselves to their keepers but after hand rearing a joey it cannot usually be released into the wild and be expected to provide for itself immediately"
kangaroo usually wildlife sanctuaries are willing to adopt kangaroos which are no longer practical or have grown too large to contain needing at least 1 acre and 7ft boundary fences for a fully grown kangaroo
kangaroo kangaroos have been featured on coins as well as being used as emblems and logos
kangaroo they have also been used as mascots and in the naming of sports teams and are extremely well represented in films television toys and souvenirs around the world
