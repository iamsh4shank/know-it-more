organ that controls the nervous system in vertebrates and most invertebrates this article is about the brains of all types of animals including humans
for information specific to the human brain see human brain
for other uses see brain (disambiguation) and brains (disambiguation) a brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals
it is located in the head usually close to the sensory organs for senses such as vision
it is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body
in a human the cerebral cortex contains approximately 14–16 billion neurons and the estimated number of neurons in the cerebellum is 55–70 billion each neuron is connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons
these neurons typically communicate with one another by means of long fibers called axons which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells
physiologically brains exert centralized control over a body's other organs
they act on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones
this centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment
some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain
the operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions is yet to be solved recent models in modern neuroscience treat the brain as a biological computer very different in mechanism from an electronic computer but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world stores it and processes it in a variety of ways
this article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal species with the greatest attention to vertebrates
it deals with the human brain insofar as it shares the properties of other brains
the ways in which the human brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article
several topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can be said about them in a human context
the most important that are covered in the human brain article are brain disease and the effects of brain damage

"cross section of the olfactory bulb of a rat stained in two different ways at the same time one stain shows neuron cell bodies the other shows receptors for the neurotransmitter the shape and size of the brain varies greatly between species and identifying common features is often difficult nevertheless there are a number of principles of brain architecture that apply across a wide range of species some aspects of brain structure are common to almost the entire range of animal species others distinguish ""advanced"" brains from more primitive ones or distinguish vertebrates from invertebrates the simplest way to gain information about brain anatomy is by visual inspection but many more sophisticated techniques have been developed"
brain tissue in its natural state is too soft to work with but it can be hardened by immersion in alcohol or other fixatives and then sliced apart for examination of the interior
visually the interior of the brain consists of areas of so called grey matter with a dark color separated by areas of white matter with a lighter color
further information can be gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of molecules are present in high concentrations
it is also possible to examine the microstructure of brain tissue using a microscope and to trace the pattern of connections from one brain area to another cellular structure neurons generate electrical signals that travel along their axons
when a pulse of electricity reaches a junction called a synapse it causes a neurotransmitter chemical to be released which binds to receptors on other cells and thereby alters their electrical activity
the brains of all species are composed primarily of two broad classes of cells neurons and glial cells
glial cells (also known as glia or neuroglia) come in several types and perform a number of critical functions including structural support metabolic support insulation and guidance of development
neurons however are usually considered the most important cells in the brain the property that makes neurons unique is their ability to send signals to specific target cells over long distances they send these signals by means of an axon which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects usually with numerous branches to other areas sometimes nearby sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body
the length of an axon can be extraordinary for example if a pyramidal cell (an excitatory neuron) of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human body its axon equally magnified would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter extending more than a kilometer these axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1–100 meters per second
some neurons emit action potentials constantly at rates of 10–100 per second usually in irregular patterns other neurons are quiet most of the time but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials axons transmit signals to other neurons by means of specialized junctions called synapses
a single axon may make as many as several thousand synaptic connections with other cells when an action potential traveling along an axon arrives at a synapse it causes a chemical called a neurotransmitter to be released
the neurotransmitter binds to receptor molecules in the membrane of the target cell synapses are the key functional elements of the brain the essential function of the brain is cell to cell communication and synapses are the points at which communication occurs
the human brain has been estimated to contain approximately 100 trillion synapses even the brain of a fruit fly contains several million the functions of these synapses are very diverse some are excitatory (exciting the target cell) others are inhibitory others work by activating second messenger systems that change the internal chemistry of their target cells in complex ways a large number of synapses are dynamically modifiable that is they are capable of changing strength in a way that is controlled by the patterns of signals that pass through them
it is widely believed that activity dependent modification of synapses is the brain's primary mechanism for learning and memory most of the space in the brain is taken up by axons which are often bundled together in what are called nerve fiber tracts
a myelinated axon is wrapped in a fatty insulating sheath of myelin which serves to greatly increase the speed of signal propagation
(there are also unmyelinated axons)
"myelin is white making parts of the brain filled exclusively with nerve fibers appear as light colored white matter in contrast to the darker colored grey matter that marks areas with high densities of neuron cell bodies evolution generic bilaterian nervous system nervous system of a generic bilaterian animal in the form of a nerve cord with segmental enlargements and a ""brain"" at the front except for a few primitive organisms such as sponges (which have no nervous system)and cnidarians (which have a nervous system consisting of a diffuse nerve net) all living multicellular animals are bilaterians meaning animals with a bilaterally symmetric body shape (that is left and right sides that are approximate mirror images of each other) all bilaterians are thought to have descended from a common ancestor that appeared late in the cryogenian period 700–650 million years ago and it has been hypothesized that this common ancestor had the shape of a simple tubeworm with a segmented body at a schematic level that basic worm shape continues to be reflected in the body and nervous system architecture of all modern bilaterians including vertebrates the fundamental bilateral body form is a tube with a hollow gut cavity running from the mouth to the anus and a nerve cord with an enlargement (a ganglion) for each body segment with an especially large ganglion at the front called the brain"
"the brain is small and simple in some species such as nematode worms in other species including vertebrates it is the most complex organ in the body some types of worms such as leeches also have an enlarged ganglion at the back end of the nerve cord known as a ""tail brain"" there are a few types of existing bilaterians that lack a recognizable brain including echinoderms and tunicates"
it has not been definitively established whether the existence of these brainless species indicates that the earliest bilaterians lacked a brain or whether their ancestors evolved in a way that led to the disappearance of a previously existing brain structure
invertebrates drosophila) have been extensively studied to gain insight into the role of genes in brain development
fruit flies () have been extensively studied to gain insight into the role of genes in brain development
this category includes tardigrades arthropods molluscs and numerous types of worms
the diversity of invertebrate body plans is matched by an equal diversity in brain structures two groups of invertebrates have notably complex brains arthropods (insects crustaceans arachnids and others) and cephalopods (octopuses squids and similar molluscs) the brains of arthropods and cephalopods arise from twin parallel nerve cords that extend through the body of the animal
arthropods have a central brain the supraesophageal ganglion with three divisions and large optical lobes behind each eye for visual processing cephalopods such as the octopus and squid have the largest brains of any invertebrates there are several invertebrate species whose brains have been studied intensively because they have properties that make them convenient for experimental work fruit flies ( drosophila ) because of the large array of techniques available for studying their genetics have been a natural subject for studying the role of genes in brain development in spite of the large evolutionary distance between insects and mammals many aspects of drosophila neurogenetics have been shown to be relevant to humans
the first biological clock genes for example were identified by examining drosophila mutants that showed disrupted daily activity cycles a search in the genomes of vertebrates revealed a set of analogous genes which were found to play similar roles in the mouse biological clock—and therefore almost certainly in the human biological clock as well studies done on drosophila also show that most neuropil regions of the brain are continuously reorganized throughout life in response to specific living conditions

the nematode worm caenorhabditis elegans like drosophila has been studied largely because of its importance in genetics in the early 1970s sydney brenner chose it as a model organism for studying the way that genes control development
one of the advantages of working with this worm is that the body plan is very stereotyped the nervous system of the hermaphrodite contains exactly 302 neurons always in the same places making identical synaptic connections in every worm brenner's team sliced worms into thousands of ultrathin sections and photographed each one under an electron microscope then visually matched fibers from section to section to map out every neuron and synapse in the entire body the complete neuronal wiring diagram of c elegans – its connectome was achieved nothing approaching this level of detail is available for any other organism and the information gained has enabled a multitude of studies that would otherwise have not been possible like has been studied largely because of its importance in genetics

the sea slug aplysia californica was chosen by nobel prize winning neurophysiologist eric kandel as a model for studying the cellular basis of learning and memory because of the simplicity and accessibility of its nervous system and it has been examined in hundreds of experiments vertebrates the brain of a shark the first vertebrates appeared over 500 million years ago (mya) during the cambrian period and may have resembled the modern hagfish in form jawed fish appeared by 445 mya amphibians by 350 mya reptiles by 310 mya and mammals by 200 mya (approximately)
each species has an equally long evolutionary history but the brains of modern hagfishes lampreys sharks amphibians reptiles and mammals show a gradient of size and complexity that roughly follows the evolutionary sequence
all of these brains contain the same set of basic anatomical components but many are rudimentary in the hagfish whereas in mammals the foremost part (the telencephalon) is greatly elaborated and expanded brains are most commonly compared in terms of their size
the relationship between brain size body size and other variables has been studied across a wide range of vertebrate species
as a rule brain size increases with body size but not in a simple linear proportion
in general smaller animals tend to have larger brains measured as a fraction of body size
for mammals the relationship between brain volume and body mass essentially follows a power law with an exponent of about 0 75 this formula describes the central tendency but every family of mammals departs from it to some degree in a way that reflects in part the complexity of their behavior
for example primates have brains 5 to 10 times larger than the formula predicts
predators tend to have larger brains than their prey relative to body size the main subdivisions of the embryonic vertebrate brain (left) which later differentiate into structures of the adult brain (right) all vertebrate brains share a common underlying form which appears most clearly during early stages of embryonic development
in its earliest form the brain appears as three swellings at the front end of the neural tube these swellings eventually become the forebrain midbrain and hindbrain (the prosencephalon mesencephalon and rhombencephalon respectively)
at the earliest stages of brain development the three areas are roughly equal in size
in many classes of vertebrates such as fish and amphibians the three parts remain similar in size in the adult but in mammals the forebrain becomes much larger than the other parts and the midbrain becomes very small the brains of vertebrates are made of very soft tissue living brain tissue is pinkish on the outside and mostly white on the inside with subtle variations in color
vertebrate brains are surrounded by a system of connective tissue membranes called meninges that separate the skull from the brain
blood vessels enter the central nervous system through holes in the meningeal layers
the cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly to one another forming the blood–brain barrier which blocks the passage of many toxins and pathogens(though at the same time blocking antibodies and some drugs thereby presenting special challenges in treatment of diseases of the brain) neuroanatomists usually divide the vertebrate brain into six main regions the telencephalon (cerebral hemispheres) diencephalon (thalamus and hypothalamus) mesencephalon (midbrain) cerebellum pons and medulla oblongata
each of these areas has a complex internal structure
some parts such as the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar cortex consist of layers that are folded or convoluted to fit within the available space
other parts such as the thalamus and hypothalamus consist of clusters of many small nuclei
thousands of distinguishable areas can be identified within the vertebrate brain based on fine distinctions of neural structure chemistry and connectivity the main anatomical regions of the vertebrate brain shown for shark and human
the same parts are present but they differ greatly in size and shape
although the same basic components are present in all vertebrate brains some branches of vertebrate evolution have led to substantial distortions of brain geometry especially in the forebrain area
"the brain of a shark shows the basic components in a straightforward way but in teleost fishes (the great majority of existing fish species) the forebrain has become ""everted"" like a sock turned inside out"
in birds there are also major changes in forebrain structure these distortions can make it difficult to match brain components from one species with those of another species here is a list of some of the most important vertebrate brain components along with a brief description of their functions as currently understood the medulla along with the spinal cord contains many small nuclei involved in a wide variety of sensory and involuntary motor functions such as vomiting heart rate and digestive processes the pons lies in the brainstem directly above the medulla
among other things it contains nuclei that control often voluntary but simple acts such as sleep respiration swallowing bladder function equilibrium eye movement facial expressions and posture the hypothalamus is a small region at the base of the forebrain whose complexity and importance belies its size
it is composed of numerous small nuclei each with distinct connections and neurochemistry
the hypothalamus is engaged in additional involuntary or partially voluntary acts such as sleep and wake cycles eating and drinking and the release of some hormones the thalamus is a collection of nuclei with diverse functions some are involved in relaying information to and from the cerebral hemispheres while others are involved in motivation
"the subthalamic area (zona incerta) seems to contain action generating systems for several types of ""consummatory"" behaviors such as eating drinking defecation and copulation the cerebellum modulates the outputs of other brain systems whether motor related or thought related to make them certain and precise"
removal of the cerebellum does not prevent an animal from doing anything in particular but it makes actions hesitant and clumsy
this precision is not built in but learned by trial and error
the muscle coordination learned while riding a bicycle is an example of a type of neural plasticity that may take place largely within the cerebellum 10% of the brain's total volume consists of the cerebellum and 50% of all neurons are held within its structure 10% of the brain's total volume consists of the cerebellum and 50% of all neurons are held within its structure
the optic tectum allows actions to be directed toward points in space most commonly in response to visual input
in mammals it is usually referred to as the superior colliculus and its best studied function is to direct eye movements
it also directs reaching movements and other object directed actions
it receives strong visual inputs but also inputs from other senses that are useful in directing actions such as auditory input in owls and input from the thermosensitive pit organs in snakes
in some primitive fishes such as lampreys this region is the largest part of the brain the superior colliculus is part of the midbrain
the superior colliculus is part of the midbrain
the pallium is a layer of grey matter that lies on the surface of the forebrain and is the most complex and most recent evolutionary development of the brain as an organ in reptiles and mammals it is called the cerebral cortex
multiple functions involve the pallium including smell and spatial memory
in mammals where it becomes so large as to dominate the brain it takes over functions from many other brain areas
in many mammals the cerebral cortex consists of folded bulges called gyri that create deep furrows or fissures called sulci
the folds increase the surface area of the cortex and therefore increase the amount of gray matter and the amount of information that can be stored and processed in reptiles and mammals it is called the

the folds increase the surface area of the cortex and therefore increase the amount of gray matter and the amount of information that can be stored and processed
the hippocampus strictly speaking is found only in mammals
however the area it derives from the medial pallium has counterparts in all vertebrates
there is evidence that this part of the brain is involved in complex events such as spatial memory and navigation in fishes birds reptiles and mammals the basal ganglia are a group of interconnected structures in the forebrain
the primary function of the basal ganglia appears to be action selection they send inhibitory signals to all parts of the brain that can generate motor behaviors and in the right circumstances can release the inhibition so that the action generating systems are able to execute their actions
reward and punishment exert their most important neural effects by altering connections within the basal ganglia the olfactory bulb is a special structure that processes olfactory sensory signals and sends its output to the olfactory part of the pallium
it is a major brain component in many vertebrates but is greatly reduced in humans and other primates (whose senses are dominated by information acquired by sight rather than smell) reptiles birds mammals the most obvious difference between the brains of mammals and other vertebrates is in terms of size
on average a mammal has a brain roughly twice as large as that of a bird of the same body size and ten times as large as that of a reptile of the same body size size however is not the only difference there are also substantial differences in shape
the hindbrain and midbrain of mammals are generally similar to those of other vertebrates but dramatic differences appear in the forebrain which is greatly enlarged and also altered in structure the cerebral cortex is the part of the brain that most strongly distinguishes mammals
in non mammalian vertebrates the surface of the cerebrum is lined with a comparatively simple three layered structure called the pallium
in mammals the pallium evolves into a complex six layered structure called neocortex or isocortex several areas at the edge of the neocortex including the hippocampus and amygdala are also much more extensively developed in mammals than in other vertebrates the elaboration of the cerebral cortex carries with it changes to other brain areas
the superior colliculus which plays a major role in visual control of behavior in most vertebrates shrinks to a small size in mammals and many of its functions are taken over by visual areas of the cerebral cortex the cerebellum of mammals contains a large portion (the neocerebellum) dedicated to supporting the cerebral cortex which has no counterpart in other vertebrates primates the brains of humans and other primates contain the same structures as the brains of other mammals but are generally larger in proportion to body size the encephalization quotient (eq) is used to compare brain sizes across species
it takes into account the nonlinearity of the brain to body relationship humans have an average eq in the 7 to 8 range while most other primates have an eq in the 2 to 3 range
dolphins have values higher than those of primates other than humans but nearly all other mammals have eq values that are substantially lower
most of the enlargement of the primate brain comes from a massive expansion of the cerebral cortex especially the prefrontal cortex and the parts of the cortex involved in vision the visual processing network of primates includes at least 30 distinguishable brain areas with a complex web of interconnections
it has been estimated that visual processing areas occupy more than half of the total surface of the primate neocortex the prefrontal cortex carries out functions that include planning working memory motivation attention and executive control
it takes up a much larger proportion of the brain for primates than for other species and an especially large fraction of the human brain development brain of a human embryo in the sixth week of development the brain develops in an intricately orchestrated sequence of stages it changes in shape from a simple swelling at the front of the nerve cord in the earliest embryonic stages to a complex array of areas and connections
neurons are created in special zones that contain stem cells and then migrate through the tissue to reach their ultimate locations
once neurons have positioned themselves their axons sprout and navigate through the brain branching and extending as they go until the tips reach their targets and form synaptic connections
in a number of parts of the nervous system neurons and synapses are produced in excessive numbers during the early stages and then the unneeded ones are pruned away for vertebrates the early stages of neural development are similar across all species as the embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure a narrow strip of ectoderm running along the midline of the back is induced to become the neural plate the precursor of the nervous system
the neural plate folds inward to form the neural groove and then the lips that line the groove merge to enclose the neural tube a hollow cord of cells with a fluid filled ventricle at the center
at the front end the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the prosencephalon (forebrain) mesencephalon (midbrain) and rhombencephalon (hindbrain)
at the next stage the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the telencephalon (which will contain the cerebral cortex basal ganglia and related structures) and the diencephalon (which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus)
at about the same time the hindbrain splits into the metencephalon (which will contain the cerebellum and pons) and the myelencephalon (which will contain the medulla oblongata)
each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated the resulting cells then migrate sometimes for long distances to their final positions once a neuron is in place it extends dendrites and an axon into the area around it
axons because they commonly extend a great distance from the cell body and need to reach specific targets grow in a particularly complex way
the tip of a growing axon consists of a blob of protoplasm called a growth cone studded with chemical receptors
these receptors sense the local environment causing the growth cone to be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each point along its path
the result of this pathfinding process is that the growth cone navigates through the brain until it reaches its destination area where other chemical cues cause it to begin generating synapses
considering the entire brain thousands of genes create products that influence axonal pathfinding the synaptic network that finally emerges is only partly determined by genes though
"in many parts of the brain axons initially ""overgrow"" and then are ""pruned"" by mechanisms that depend on neural activity in the projection from the eye to the midbrain for example the structure in the adult contains a very precise mapping connecting each point on the surface of the retina to a corresponding point in a midbrain layer"
in the first stages of development each axon from the retina is guided to the right general vicinity in the midbrain by chemical cues but then branches very profusely and makes initial contact with a wide swath of midbrain neurons
the retina before birth contains special mechanisms that cause it to generate waves of activity that originate spontaneously at a random point and then propagate slowly across the retinal layer
these waves are useful because they cause neighboring neurons to be active at the same time that is they produce a neural activity pattern that contains information about the spatial arrangement of the neurons
this information is exploited in the midbrain by a mechanism that causes synapses to weaken and eventually vanish if activity in an axon is not followed by activity of the target cell
the result of this sophisticated process is a gradual tuning and tightening of the map leaving it finally in its precise adult form similar things happen in other brain areas an initial synaptic matrix is generated as a result of genetically determined chemical guidance but then gradually refined by activity dependent mechanisms partly driven by internal dynamics partly by external sensory inputs
in some cases as with the retina midbrain system activity patterns depend on mechanisms that operate only in the developing brain and apparently exist solely to guide development in humans and many other mammals new neurons are created mainly before birth and the infant brain contains substantially more neurons than the adult brain there are however a few areas where new neurons continue to be generated throughout life
the two areas for which adult neurogenesis is well established are the olfactory bulb which is involved in the sense of smell and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus where there is evidence that the new neurons play a role in storing newly acquired memories
with these exceptions however the set of neurons that is present in early childhood is the set that is present for life
glial cells are different as with most types of cells in the body they are generated throughout the lifespan there has long been debate about whether the qualities of mind personality and intelligence can be attributed to heredity or to upbringing—this is the nature and nurture controversy although many details remain to be settled neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important
genes determine the general form of the brain and genes determine how the brain reacts to experience
experience however is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections which in its developed form contains far more information than the genome does
in some respects all that matters is the presence or absence of experience during critical periods of development in other respects the quantity and quality of experience are important for example there is substantial evidence that animals raised in enriched environments have thicker cerebral cortices indicating a higher density of synaptic connections than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted physiology the functions of the brain depend on the ability of neurons to transmit electrochemical signals to other cells and their ability to respond appropriately to electrochemical signals received from other cells
the electrical properties of neurons are controlled by a wide variety of biochemical and metabolic processes most notably the interactions between neurotransmitters and receptors that take place at synapses neurotransmitters and receptors neurotransmitters are chemicals that are released at synapses when the local membrane is depolarised and ca2+ enters into the cell typically when an action potential arrives at the synapse – neurotransmitters attach themselves to receptor molecules on the membrane of the synapse's target cell (or cells) and thereby alter the electrical or chemical properties of the receptor molecules
with few exceptions each neuron in the brain releases the same chemical neurotransmitter or combination of neurotransmitters at all the synaptic connections it makes with other neurons this rule is known as dale's principle thus a neuron can be characterized by the neurotransmitters that it releases
the great majority of psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering specific neurotransmitter systems
this applies to drugs such as cannabinoids nicotine heroin cocaine alcohol fluoxetine chlorpromazine and many others the two neurotransmitters that are most widely found in the vertebrate brain are glutamate which almost always exerts excitatory effects on target neurons and gamma aminobutyric acid (gaba) which is almost always inhibitory
neurons using these transmitters can be found in nearly every part of the brain because of their ubiquity drugs that act on glutamate or gaba tend to have broad and powerful effects
some general anesthetics act by reducing the effects of glutamate most tranquilizers exert their sedative effects by enhancing the effects of gaba there are dozens of other chemical neurotransmitters that are used in more limited areas of the brain often areas dedicated to a particular function
serotonin for example—the primary target of many antidepressant drugs and many dietary aids—comes exclusively from a small brainstem area called the raphe nuclei norepinephrine which is involved in arousal comes exclusively from a nearby small area called the locus coeruleus other neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and dopamine have multiple sources in the brain but are not as ubiquitously distributed as glutamate and gaba electrical activity brain electrical activity recorded from a human patient during an epileptic seizure as a side effect of the electrochemical processes used by neurons for signaling brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active
when large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull using electroencephalography (eeg)or magnetoencephalography (meg)
eeg recordings along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active even during sleep each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity which may vary according to behavioral state
in mammals the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep faster alpha waves when the animal is awake but inattentive and chaotic looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task called beta and gamma waves
during an epileptic seizure the brain's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels producing eeg traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain
relating these population level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology metabolism all vertebrates have a blood–brain barrier that allows metabolism inside the brain to operate differently from metabolism in other parts of the body
glial cells play a major role in brain metabolism by controlling the chemical composition of the fluid that surrounds neurons including levels of ions and nutrients brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals
the need to limit body weight in order for example to fly has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species such as bats most of the brain's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge (membrane potential) of neurons most vertebrate species devote between 2% and 8% of basal metabolism to the brain
in primates however the percentage is much higher—in humans it rises to 20–25% the energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods of pet fmri and nirs the brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen dependent metabolism of glucose (i e blood sugar) but ketones provide a major alternative source together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids (caprylic and heptanoic acids) lactate acetate and possibly amino acids function information from the sense organs is collected in the brain
there it is used to determine what actions the organism is to take
the brain processes the raw data to extract information about the structure of the environment
next it combines the processed information with information about the current needs of the animal and with memory of past circumstances
finally on the basis of the results it generates motor response patterns
these signal processing tasks require intricate interplay between a variety of functional subsystems the function of the brain is to provide coherent control over the actions of an animal
a centralized brain allows groups of muscles to be co activated in complex patterns it also allows stimuli impinging on one part of the body to evoke responses in other parts and it can prevent different parts of the body from acting at cross purposes to each other perception the human brain is provided with information about light sound the chemical composition of the atmosphere temperature the position of the body in space (proprioception) the chemical composition of the bloodstream and more
in other animals additional senses are present such as the infrared heat sense of snakes the magnetic field sense of some birds or the electric field sense mainly seen in aquatic animals
each sensory system begins with specialized receptor cells such as photoreceptor cells in the retina of the eye or vibration sensitive hair cells in the cochlea of the ear
the axons of sensory receptor cells travel into the spinal cord or brain where they transmit their signals to a first order sensory nucleus dedicated to one specific sensory modality
this primary sensory nucleus sends information to higher order sensory areas that are dedicated to the same modality
eventually via a way station in the thalamus the signals are sent to the cerebral cortex where they are processed to extract the relevant features and integrated with signals coming from other sensory systems motor control motor systems are areas of the brain that are involved in initiating body movements that is in activating muscles
except for the muscles that control the eye which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord and by inputs that descend from the brain
the intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming
the descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control the brain contains several motor areas that project directly to the spinal cord
at the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons which control stereotyped movements such as walking breathing or swallowing
at a higher level are areas in the midbrain such as the red nucleus which is responsible for coordinating movements of the arms and legs
at a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe
the primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord through the pyramidal tract
this direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements
other motor related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas
among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex supplementary motor area basal ganglia and cerebellum in addition to all of the above the brain and spinal cord contain extensive circuitry to control the autonomic nervous system which controls the movement of the smooth muscle of the body sleep many animals alternate between sleeping and waking in a daily cycle
arousal and alertness are also modulated on a finer time scale by a network of brain areas a key component of the sleep system is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn) a tiny part of the hypothalamus located directly above the point at which the optic nerves from the two eyes cross
the scn contains the body's central biological clock
"neurons there show activity levels that rise and fall with a period of about 24 hours circadian rhythms these activity fluctuations are driven by rhythmic changes in expression of a set of ""clock genes"""
the scn continues to keep time even if it is excised from the brain and placed in a dish of warm nutrient solution but it ordinarily receives input from the optic nerves through the retinohypothalamic tract (rht) that allows daily light dark cycles to calibrate the clock the scn projects to a set of areas in the hypothalamus brainstem and midbrain that are involved in implementing sleep wake cycles
an important component of the system is the reticular formation a group of neuron clusters scattered diffusely through the core of the lower brain
reticular neurons send signals to the thalamus which in turn sends activity level controlling signals to every part of the cortex
damage to the reticular formation can produce a permanent state of coma sleep involves great changes in brain activity until the 1950s it was generally believed that the brain essentially shuts off during sleep but this is now known to be far from true activity continues but patterns become very different
there are two types of sleep rem sleep (with dreaming) and nrem (non rem usually without dreaming) sleep which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a sleep episode
three broad types of distinct brain activity patterns can be measured rem light nrem and deep nrem
during deep nrem sleep also called slow wave sleep activity in the cortex takes the form of large synchronized waves whereas in the waking state it is noisy and desynchronized
"levels of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin drop during slow wave sleep and fall almost to zero during rem sleep levels of acetylcholine show the reverse pattern homeostasis cross section of a human head showing location of the hypothalamus for any animal survival requires maintaining a variety of parameters of bodily state within a limited range of variation these include temperature water content salt concentration in the bloodstream blood glucose levels blood oxygen level and others the ability of an animal to regulate the internal environment of its body—the milieu intérieur as the pioneering physiologist claude bernard called it—is known as homeostasis (greek for ""standing still"") maintaining homeostasis is a crucial function of the brain"
the basic principle that underlies homeostasis is negative feedback any time a parameter diverges from its set point sensors generate an error signal that evokes a response that causes the parameter to shift back toward its optimum value
(this principle is widely used in engineering for example in the control of temperature using a thermostat )
in vertebrates the part of the brain that plays the greatest role is the hypothalamus a small region at the base of the forebrain whose size does not reflect its complexity or the importance of its function the hypothalamus is a collection of small nuclei most of which are involved in basic biological functions
some of these functions relate to arousal or to social interactions such as sexuality aggression or maternal behaviors but many of them relate to homeostasis
several hypothalamic nuclei receive input from sensors located in the lining of blood vessels conveying information about temperature sodium level glucose level blood oxygen level and other parameters
these hypothalamic nuclei send output signals to motor areas that can generate actions to rectify deficiencies
some of the outputs also go to the pituitary gland a tiny gland attached to the brain directly underneath the hypothalamus
the pituitary gland secretes hormones into the bloodstream where they circulate throughout the body and induce changes in cellular activity motivation the individual animals need to express survival promoting behaviors such as seeking food water shelter and a mate the motivational system in the brain monitors the current state of satisfaction of these goals and activates behaviors to meet any needs that arise
the motivational system works largely by a reward–punishment mechanism
when a particular behavior is followed by favorable consequences the reward mechanism in the brain is activated which induces structural changes inside the brain that cause the same behavior to be repeated later whenever a similar situation arises
conversely when a behavior is followed by unfavorable consequences the brain's punishment mechanism is activated inducing structural changes that cause the behavior to be suppressed when similar situations arise in the future most organisms studied to date use a reward–punishment mechanism for instance worms and insects can alter their behavior to seek food sources or to avoid dangers in vertebrates the reward punishment system is implemented by a specific set of brain structures at the heart of which lie the basal ganglia a set of interconnected areas at the base of the forebrain the basal ganglia are the central site at which decisions are made the basal ganglia exert a sustained inhibitory control over most of the motor systems in the brain when this inhibition is released a motor system is permitted to execute the action it is programmed to carry out
rewards and punishments function by altering the relationship between the inputs that the basal ganglia receive and the decision signals that are emitted
the reward mechanism is better understood than the punishment mechanism because its role in drug abuse has caused it to be studied very intensively
research has shown that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a central role addictive drugs such as cocaine amphetamine and nicotine either cause dopamine levels to rise or cause the effects of dopamine inside the brain to be enhanced learning and memory almost all animals are capable of modifying their behavior as a result of experience—even the most primitive types of worms
because behavior is driven by brain activity changes in behavior must somehow correspond to changes inside the brain
already in the late 19th century theorists like santiago ramón y cajal argued that the most plausible explanation is that learning and memory are expressed as changes in the synaptic connections between neurons until 1970 however experimental evidence to support the synaptic plasticity hypothesis was lacking
in 1971 tim bliss and terje lømo published a paper on a phenomenon now called long term potentiation the paper showed clear evidence of activity induced synaptic changes that lasted for at least several days since then technical advances have made these sorts of experiments much easier to carry out and thousands of studies have been made that have clarified the mechanism of synaptic change and uncovered other types of activity driven synaptic change in a variety of brain areas including the cerebral cortex hippocampus basal ganglia and cerebellum brain derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) and physical activity appear to play a beneficial role in the process neuroscientists currently distinguish several types of learning and memory that are implemented by the brain in distinct ways working memory is the ability of the brain to maintain a temporary representation of information about the task that an animal is currently engaged in
this sort of dynamic memory is thought to be mediated by the formation of cell assemblies—groups of activated neurons that maintain their activity by constantly stimulating one another is the ability of the brain to maintain a temporary representation of information about the task that an animal is currently engaged in

episodic memory is the ability to remember the details of specific events
this sort of memory can last for a lifetime
much evidence implicates the hippocampus in playing a crucial role people with severe damage to the hippocampus sometimes show amnesia that is inability to form new long lasting episodic memories is the ability to remember the details of specific events

motor learning is the ability to refine patterns of body movement by practicing or more generally by repetition

for the scientific journal see brain research the human brain project is a large scientific research project starting in 2013 which aims to simulate the complete human brain
the field of neuroscience encompasses all approaches that seek to understand the brain and the rest of the nervous system psychology seeks to understand mind and behavior and neurology is the medical discipline that diagnoses and treats diseases of the nervous system
the brain is also the most important organ studied in psychiatry the branch of medicine that works to study prevent and treat mental disorders cognitive science seeks to unify neuroscience and psychology with other fields that concern themselves with the brain such as computer science (artificial intelligence and similar fields) and philosophy the oldest method of studying the brain is anatomical and until the middle of the 20th century much of the progress in neuroscience came from the development of better cell stains and better microscopes
neuroanatomists study the large scale structure of the brain as well as the microscopic structure of neurons and their components especially synapses
among other tools they employ a plethora of stains that reveal neural structure chemistry and connectivity
in recent years the development of immunostaining techniques has allowed investigation of neurons that express specific sets of genes
also functional neuroanatomy uses medical imaging techniques to correlate variations in human brain structure with differences in cognition or behavior neurophysiologists study the chemical pharmacological and electrical properties of the brain their primary tools are drugs and recording devices
thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system some in highly specific ways
recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes either glued to the scalp as in eeg studies or implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular recordings which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons because the brain does not contain pain receptors it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress
the same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients with intractable epilepsy in cases where there was a medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures functional imaging techniques such as fmri are also used to study brain activity these techniques have mainly been used with human subjects because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive design of an experiment in which brain activity from a monkey was used to control a robotic arm another approach to brain function is to examine the consequences of damage to specific brain areas
even though it is protected by the skull and meninges surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage
in humans the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function
because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage however this information is often difficult to interpret
in animal studies most commonly involving rats it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior computational neuroscience encompasses two approaches first the use of computers to study the brain second the study of how brains perform computation
on one hand it is possible to write a computer program to simulate the operation of a group of neurons by making use of systems of equations that describe their electrochemical activity such simulations are known as biologically realistic neural networks
"on the other hand it is possible to study algorithms for neural computation by simulating or mathematically analyzing the operations of simplified ""units"" that have some of the properties of neurons but abstract out much of their biological complexity"
the computational functions of the brain are studied both by computer scientists and neuroscientists computational neurogenetic modeling is concerned with the study and development of dynamic neuronal models for modeling brain functions with respect to genes and dynamic interactions between genes
recent years have seen increasing applications of genetic and genomic techniques to the study of the brainand a focus on the roles of neurotrophic factors and physical activity in neuroplasticity the most common subjects are mice because of the availability of technical tools
"it is now possible with relative ease to ""knock out"" or mutate a wide variety of genes and then examine the effects on brain function"
more sophisticated approaches are also being used for example using cre lox recombination it is possible to activate or deactivate genes in specific parts of the brain at specific times history illustration by rené descartes of how the brain implements a reflex response the oldest brain to have been discovered was in armenia in the areni 1 cave complex
the brain estimated to be over 5 00 years old was found in the skull of a 12 to 14 year old girl
although the brains were shriveled they were well preserved due to the climate found inside the cave early philosophers were divided as to whether the seat of the soul lies in the brain or heart
aristotle favored the heart and thought that the function of the brain was merely to cool the blood
democritus the inventor of the atomic theory of matter argued for a three part soul with intellect in the head emotion in the heart and lust near the liver the unknown author of on the sacred disease a medical treatise in the hippocratic corpus came down unequivocally in favor of the brain writing men ought to know that from nothing else but the brain come joys delights laughter and sports and sorrows griefs despondency and lamentations
and by the same organ we become mad and delirious and fears and terrors assail us some by night and some by day and dreams and untimely wanderings and cares that are not suitable and ignorance of present circumstances desuetude and unskillfulness
all these things we endure from the brain when it is not healthy on the sacred disease attributed to hippocratesthe roman physician galen also argued for the importance of the brain and theorized in some depth about how it might work
galen traced out the anatomical relationships among brain nerves and muscles demonstrating that all muscles in the body are connected to the brain through a branching network of nerves
"he postulated that nerves activate muscles mechanically by carrying a mysterious substance he called pneumata psychikon usually translated as ""animal spirits"" galen's ideas were widely known during the middle ages but not much further progress came until the renaissance when detailed anatomical study resumed combined with the theoretical speculations of rené descartes and those who followed him"
descartes like galen thought of the nervous system in hydraulic terms
he believed that the highest cognitive functions are carried out by a non physical res cogitans but that the majority of behaviors of humans and all behaviors of animals could be explained mechanistically the first real progress toward a modern understanding of nervous function though came from the investigations of luigi galvani (1737–1798) who discovered that a shock of static electricity applied to an exposed nerve of a dead frog could cause its leg to contract
since that time each major advance in understanding has followed more or less directly from the development of a new technique of investigation
until the early years of the 20th century the most important advances were derived from new methods for staining cells particularly critical was the invention of the golgi stain which (when correctly used) stains only a small fraction of neurons but stains them in their entirety including cell body dendrites and axon
without such a stain brain tissue under a microscope appears as an impenetrable tangle of protoplasmic fibers in which it is impossible to determine any structure
in the hands of camillo golgi and especially of the spanish neuroanatomist santiago ramón y cajal the new stain revealed hundreds of distinct types of neurons each with its own unique dendritic structure and pattern of connectivity drawing by santiago ramón y cajal of two types of golgi stained neurons from the cerebellum of a pigeon in the first half of the 20th century advances in electronics enabled investigation of the electrical properties of nerve cells culminating in work by alan hodgkin andrew huxley and others on the biophysics of the action potential and the work of bernard katz and others on the electrochemistry of the synapse these studies complemented the anatomical picture with a conception of the brain as a dynamic entity
reflecting the new understanding in 1942 charles sherrington visualized the workings of the brain waking from sleep the great topmost sheet of the mass that where hardly a light had twinkled or moved becomes now a sparkling field of rhythmic flashing points with trains of traveling sparks hurrying hither and thither
the brain is waking and with it the mind is returning
it is as if the milky way entered upon some cosmic dance
swiftly the head mass becomes an enchanted loom where millions of flashing shuttles weave a dissolving pattern always a meaningful pattern though never an abiding one a shifting harmony of subpatterns
—sherrington 1942 man on his naturethe invention of electronic computers in the 1940s along with the development of mathematical information theory led to a realization that brains can potentially be understood as information processing systems
"this concept formed the basis of the field of cybernetics and eventually gave rise to the field now known as computational neuroscience the earliest attempts at cybernetics were somewhat crude in that they treated the brain as essentially a digital computer in disguise as for example in john von neumann's 1958 book the computer and the brain over the years though accumulating information about the electrical responses of brain cells recorded from behaving animals has steadily moved theoretical concepts in the direction of increasing realism one of the most influential early contributions was a 1959 paper titled what the frog's eye tells the frog's brain the paper examined the visual responses of neurons in the retina and optic tectum of frogs and came to the conclusion that some neurons in the tectum of the frog are wired to combine elementary responses in a way that makes them function as ""bug perceivers"" a few years later david hubel and torsten wiesel discovered cells in the primary visual cortex of monkeys that become active when sharp edges move across specific points in the field of view—a discovery for which they won a nobel prize follow up studies in higher order visual areas found cells that detect binocular disparity color movement and aspects of shape with areas located at increasing distances from the primary visual cortex showing increasingly complex responses other investigations of brain areas unrelated to vision have revealed cells with a wide variety of response correlates some related to memory some to abstract types of cognition such as space theorists have worked to understand these response patterns by constructing mathematical models of neurons and neural networks which can be simulated using computers some useful models are abstract focusing on the conceptual structure of neural algorithms rather than the details of how they are implemented in the brain other models attempt to incorporate data about the biophysical properties of real neurons no model on any level is yet considered to be a fully valid description of brain function though"
the essential difficulty is that sophisticated computation by neural networks requires distributed processing in which hundreds or thousands of neurons work cooperatively—current methods of brain activity recording are only capable of isolating action potentials from a few dozen neurons at a time furthermore even single neurons appear to be complex and capable of performing computations so brain models that do not reflect this are too abstract to be representative of brain operation models that do try to capture this are very computationally expensive and arguably intractable with present computational resources
however the human brain project is trying to build a realistic detailed computational model of the entire human brain
the wisdom of this approach has been publicly contested with high profile scientists on both sides of the argument
in the second half of the 20th century developments in chemistry electron microscopy genetics computer science functional brain imaging and other fields progressively opened new windows into brain structure and function
"in the united states the 1990s were officially designated as the ""decade of the brain"" to commemorate advances made in brain research and to promote funding for such research in the 21st century these trends have continued and several new approaches have come into prominence including multielectrode recording which allows the activity of many brain cells to be recorded all at the same time genetic engineering which allows molecular components of the brain to be altered experimentally genomics which allows variations in brain structure to be correlated with variations in dna properties and neuroimaging society and culture as food animal brains are used as food in numerous cuisines"
in rituals some archaeological evidence suggests that the mourning rituals of european neanderthals also involved the consumption of the brain the fore people of papua new guinea are known to eat human brains
in funerary rituals those close to the dead would eat the brain of the deceased to create a sense of immortality
a prion disease called kuru has been traced to this see also
"central organ of the human nervous system ""brain tissue"" redirects here"
for brain tissue in other animals see brain the human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system
the brain consists of the cerebrum the brainstem and the cerebellum
it controls most of the activities of the body processing integrating and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body
the brain is contained in and protected by the skull bones of the head
the cerebrum the largest part of the human brain consists of two cerebral hemispheres
each hemisphere has an inner core composed of white matter and an outer surface – the cerebral cortex – composed of grey matter
the cortex has an outer layer the neocortex and an inner allocortex
the neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers while the allocortex has three or four
each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes – the frontal temporal parietal and occipital lobes
the frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self control planning reasoning and abstract thought while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision
within each lobe cortical areas are associated with specific functions such as the sensory motor and association regions
although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function some functions are associated with one side such as language in the left and visual spatial ability in the right
the hemispheres are connected by commissural nerve tracts the largest being the corpus callosum
the cerebrum is connected by the brainstem to the spinal cord
the brainstem consists of the midbrain the pons and the medulla oblongata
the cerebellum is connected to the brainstem by three pairs of nerve tracts called cerebellar peduncles
within the cerebrum is the ventricular system consisting of four interconnected ventricles in which cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated
underneath the cerebral cortex are several important structures including the thalamus the epithalamus the pineal gland the hypothalamus the pituitary gland and the subthalamus the limbic structures including the amygdalae and the hippocampi the claustrum the various nuclei of the basal ganglia the basal forebrain structures and the three circumventricular organs
brain structures that are not on the midplane exist in pairs so there are for example two hippocampi and two amygdalae
the cells of the brain include neurons and supportive glial cells
there are more than 86 billion neurons in the brain and a more or less equal number of other cells
brain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons and their release of neurotransmitters in response to nerve impulses
neurons connect to form neural pathways neural circuits and elaborate network systems
the whole circuitry is driven by the process of neurotransmission
the brain is protected by the skull suspended in cerebrospinal fluid and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier
however the brain is still susceptible to damage disease and infection
damage can be caused by trauma or a loss of blood supply known as a stroke
the brain is susceptible to degenerative disorders such as parkinson's disease dementias including alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis
psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia and clinical depression are thought to be associated with brain dysfunctions
the brain can also be the site of tumours both benign and malignant these mostly originate from other sites in the body
the study of the anatomy of the brain is neuroanatomy while the study of its function is neuroscience
numerous techniques are used to study the brain
specimens from other animals which may be examined microscopically have traditionally provided much information
medical imaging technologies such as functional neuroimaging and electroencephalography (eeg) recordings are important in studying the brain
the medical history of people with brain injury has provided insight into the function of each part of the brain
neuroscience research has expanded considerably and research is ongoing
in culture the philosophy of mind has for centuries attempted to address the question of the nature of consciousness and the mind–body problem
the pseudoscience of phrenology attempted to localise personality attributes to regions of the cortex in the 19th century
in science fiction brain transplants are imagined in tales such as the 1942 donovan's brain
structurehuman brain (sagittal section) gross anatomythe adult human brain weighs on average about 1 2–1 4 kg (2 6–3 1 lb) which is about 2% of the total body weight with a volume of around 1260 cm3 in men and 1130 cm3 in women there is substantial individual variation with the standard reference range for men being 1 180–1 620 g (2 60–3 57 lb)and for women 1 030–1 400 g (2 27–3 09 lb) the cerebrum consisting of the cerebral hemispheres forms the largest part of the brain and overlies the other brain structures
the outer region of the hemispheres the cerebral cortex is grey matter consisting of cortical layers of neurons
each hemisphere is divided into four main lobes – the frontal lobe parietal lobe temporal lobe and occipital lobe
three other lobes are included by some sources which are a central lobe a limbic lobe and an insular lobe the central lobe comprises the precentral gyrus and the postcentral gyrus and is included since it forms a distinct functional role the brainstem resembling a stalk attaches to and leaves the cerebrum at the start of the midbrain area
the brainstem includes the midbrain the pons and the medulla oblongata
behind the brainstem is the cerebellum (latin little brain)
the cerebrum brainstem cerebellum and spinal cord are covered by fourmembranes called meninges
the membranes are the tough dura mater the middle arachnoid mater and the more delicate inner pia mater
between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater is the subarachnoid space and subarachnoid cisterns which contain the cerebrospinal fluid
the outermost membrane of the cerebral cortex is the basement membrane of the pia mater called the glia limitans and is an important part of the blood–brain barrier the living brain is very soft having a gel like consistency similar to soft tofu the cortical layers of neurons constitute much of the cerebral grey matter while the deeper subcortical regions of myelinated axons make up the white matter
the white matter of the brain makes up about half of the total brain volume structural and functional areas of the human brain human brain bisected in the sagittal plane showing the white matter of the corpus callosum functional areas of the human brain
dashed areas shown are commonly left hemisphere dominant
cerebrummajor gyri and sulci on the lateral surface of the cortex lobes of the brain the cerebrum is the largest part of the brain and is divided into nearly symmetrical left and right hemispheres by a deep groove the longitudinal fissure asymmetry between the lobes is noted as a petalia the hemispheres are connected by five commissures that span the longitudinal fissure the largest of these is the corpus callosum
each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four main lobes the frontal lobe parietal lobe temporal lobe and occipital lobe named according to the skull bones that overlie them
each lobe is associated with one or two specialised functions though there is some functional overlap between them the surface of the brain is folded into ridges (gyri) and grooves (sulci) many of which are named usually according to their position such as the frontal gyrus of the frontal lobe or the central sulcus separating the central regions of the hemispheres
there are many small variations in the secondary and tertiary folds
the outer part of the cerebrum is the cerebral cortex made up of grey matter arranged in layers
it is 2 to 4 millimetres (0 079 to 0 157 in) thick and deeply folded to give a convoluted appearance beneath the cortex is the cerebral white matter
the largest part of the cerebral cortex is the neocortex which has six neuronal layers
the rest of the cortex is of allocortex which has three or four layers
the cortex is mapped by divisions into about fifty different functional areas known as brodmann's areas
these areas are distinctly different when seen under a microscope
the cortex is divided into two main functional areas – a motor cortex and a sensory cortex
the primary motor cortex which sends axons down to motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord occupies the rear portion of the frontal lobe directly in front of the somatosensory area
the primary sensory areas receive signals from the sensory nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in the thalamus
primary sensory areas include the visual cortex of the occipital lobe the auditory cortex in parts of the temporal lobe and insular cortex and the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe
the remaining parts of the cortex are called the association areas
these areas receive input from the sensory areas and lower parts of the brain and are involved in the complex cognitive processes of perception thought and decision making the main functions of the frontal lobe are to control attention abstract thinking behaviour problem solving tasks and physical reactions and personality the occipital lobe is the smallest lobe its main functions are visual reception visual spatial processing movement and colour recognition there is a smaller occipital lobule in the lobe known as the cuneus
the temporal lobe controls auditory and visual memories language and some hearing and speech cortical folds and white matter in horizontal bisection of head the cerebrum contains the ventricles where the cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated
below the corpus callosum is the septum pellucidum a membrane that separates the lateral ventricles
beneath the lateral ventricles is the thalamus and to the front and below is the hypothalamus
the hypothalamus leads on to the pituitary gland
at the back of the thalamus is the brainstem
the basal ganglia also called basal nuclei are a set of structures deep within the hemispheres involved in behaviour and movement regulation
the largest component is the striatum others are the globus pallidus the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus
the striatum is divided into a ventral striatum and dorsal striatum subdivisions that are based upon function and connections
the ventral striatum consists of the nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle whereas the dorsal striatum consists of the caudate nucleus and the putamen
the putamen and the globus pallidus lie separated from the lateral ventricles and thalamus by the internal capsule whereas the caudate nucleus stretches around and abuts the lateral ventricles on their outer sides
at the deepest part of the lateral sulcus between the insular cortex and the striatum is a thin neuronal sheet called the claustrum below and in front of the striatum are a number of basal forebrain structures
these include the nucleus basalis diagonal band of broca substantia innominata and the medial septal nucleus
these structures are important in producing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine which is then distributed widely throughout the brain
the basal forebrain in particular the nucleus basalis is considered to be the major cholinergic output of the central nervous system to the striatum and neocortex cerebellumhuman brain viewed from below showing cerebellum and brainstem the cerebellum is divided into an anterior lobe a posterior lobe and the flocculonodular lobe
the anterior and posterior lobes are connected in the middle by the vermis
compared to the cerebral cortex the cerebellum has a much thinner outer cortex that is narrowly furrowed into numerous curved transverse fissures
viewed from underneath between the two lobes is the third lobe the flocculonodular lobe the cerebellum rests at the back of the cranial cavity lying beneath the occipital lobes and is separated from these by the cerebellar tentorium a sheet of fibre
it is connected to the brainstem by three pairs of nerve tracts called cerebellar peduncles
the superior pair connects to the midbrain the middle pair connects to the medulla and the inferior pair connects to the pons
the cerebellum consists of an inner medulla of white matter and an outer cortex of richly folded grey matter
the cerebellum's anterior and posterior lobes appear to play a role in the coordination and smoothing of complex motor movements and the flocculonodular lobe in the maintenance of balance although debate exists as to its cognitive behavioural and motor functions
brainstemthe brainstem lies beneath the cerebrum and consists of the midbrain pons and medulla
it lies in the back part of the skull resting on the part of the base known as the clivus and ends at the foramen magnum a large opening in the occipital bone
the brainstem continues below this as the spinal cord protected by the vertebral column
ten of the twelve pairs of cranial nerves[a] emerge directly from the brainstem
the brainstem also contains many cranial nerve nuclei and nuclei of peripheral nerves as well as nuclei involved in the regulation of many essential processes including breathing control of eye movements and balance
the reticular formation a network of nuclei of ill defined formation is present within and along the length of the brainstem
many nerve tracts which transmit information to and from the cerebral cortex to the rest of the body pass through the brainstem
microanatomythe human brain is primarily composed of neurons glial cells neural stem cells and blood vessels
types of neuron include interneurons pyramidal cells including betz cells motor neurons (upper and lower motor neurons) and cerebellar purkinje cells
betz cells are the largest cells (by size of cell body) in the nervous system
the adult human brain is estimated to contain 86±8 billion neurons with a roughly equal number (85±10 billion) of non neuronal cells out of these neurons 16 billion (19%) are located in the cerebral cortex and 69 billion (80%) are in the cerebellum types of glial cell are astrocytes (including bergmann glia) oligodendrocytes ependymal cells (including tanycytes) radial glial cells microglia and a subtype of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells
astrocytes are the largest of the glial cells
they are stellate cells with many processes radiating from their cell bodies
some of these processes end as perivascular end feet on capillary walls the glia limitans of the cortex is made up of astrocyte foot processes that serve in part to contain the cells of the brain mast cells are white blood cells that interact in the neuroimmune system in the brain mast cells in the central nervous system are present in a number of structures including the meninges they mediate neuroimmune responses in inflammatory conditions and help to maintain the blood–brain barrier particularly in brain regions where the barrier is absent mast cells serve the same general functions in the body and central nervous system such as effecting or regulating allergic responses innate and adaptive immunity autoimmunity and inflammation mast cells serve as the main effector cell through which pathogens can affect the biochemical signaling that takes place between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system some 400 genes are shown to be brain specific
in all neurons elavl3 is expressed and in pyramidal neurons nrgn and reep2 are also expressed
gad1 – essential for the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter gaba – is expressed in interneurons
proteins expressed in glial cells include astrocyte markers gfap and s100b whereas myelin basic protein and the transcription factor olig2 are expressed in oligodendrocytes cerebrospinal fluidcerebrospinal fluid is a clear colourless transcellular fluid that circulates around the brain in the subarachnoid space in the ventricular system and in the central canal of the spinal cord
it also fills some gaps in the subarachnoid space known as subarachnoid cisterns
the four ventricles two lateral a third and a fourth ventricle all contain a choroid plexus that produces cerebrospinal fluid
the third ventricle lies in the midline and is connected to the lateral ventricles
a single duct the cerebral aqueduct between the pons and the cerebellum connects the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle
three separate openings the middle and two lateral apertures drain the cerebrospinal fluid from the fourth ventricle to the cisterna magna one of the major cisterns
from here cerebrospinal fluid circulates around the brain and spinal cord in the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid mater and pia mater
at any one time there is about 150ml of cerebrospinal fluid – most within the subarachnoid space
it is constantly being regenerated and absorbed and is replaced about once every 5–6 hours
a glymphatic system has been describedas the lymphatic drainage system of the brain
the brain wide glymphatic pathway includes drainage routes from the cerebrospinal fluid and from the meningeal lymphatic vessels that are associated with the dural sinuses and run alongside the cerebral blood vessels the pathway drains interstitial fluid from the tissue of the brain blood supplytwo circulations joining at the circle of willis (inferior view) diagram showing features of cerebral outer membranes and supply of blood vessels the internal carotid arteries supply oxygenated blood to the front of the brain and the vertebral arteries supply blood to the back of the brain
these two circulations join in the circle of willis a ring of connected arteries that lies in the interpeduncular cistern between the midbrain and pons
the internal carotid arteries are branches of the common carotid arteries
they enter the cranium through the carotid canal travel through the cavernous sinus and enter the subarachnoid space
they then enter the circle of willis with two branches the anterior cerebral arteries emerging
these branches travel forward and then upward along the longitudinal fissure and supply the front and midline parts of the brain
one or more small anterior communicating arteries join the two anterior cerebral arteries shortly after they emerge as branches
the internal carotid arteries continue forward as the middle cerebral arteries
they travel sideways along the sphenoid bone of the eye socket then upwards through the insula cortex where final branches arise
the middle cerebral arteries send branches along their length
the vertebral arteries emerge as branches of the left and right subclavian arteries
they travel upward through transverse foramina which are spaces in the cervical vertebrae
each side enters the cranial cavity through the foramen magnum along the corresponding side of the medulla
they give off one of the three cerebellar branches
the vertebral arteries join in front of the middle part of the medulla to form the larger basilar artery which sends multiple branches to supply the medulla and pons and the two other anterior and superior cerebellar branches
finally the basilar artery divides into two posterior cerebral arteries
these travel outwards around the superior cerebellar peduncles and along the top of the cerebellar tentorium where it sends branches to supply the temporal and occipital lobes
each posterior cerebral artery sends a small posterior communicating artery to join with the internal carotid arteries
blood drainagecerebral veins drain deoxygenated blood from the brain
the brain has two main networks of veins an exterior or superficial network on the surface of the cerebrum that has three branches and an interior network
these two networks communicate via anastomosing (joining) veins
the veins of the brain drain into larger cavities of the dural venous sinuses usually situated between the dura mater and the covering of the skull
blood from the cerebellum and midbrain drains into the great cerebral vein
blood from the medulla and pons of the brainstem have a variable pattern of drainage either into the spinal veins or into adjacent cerebral veins
the blood in the deep part of the brain drains through a venous plexus into the cavernous sinus at the front and the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses at the sides and the inferior sagittal sinus at the back
blood drains from the outer brain into the large superior sagittal sinus which rests in the midline on top of the brain
blood from here joins with blood from the straight sinus at the confluence of sinuses
blood from here drains into the left and right transverse sinuses
these then drain into the sigmoid sinuses which receive blood from the cavernous sinus and superior and inferior petrosal sinuses
the sigmoid drains into the large internal jugular veins
the blood–brain barrierthe larger arteries throughout the brain supply blood to smaller capillaries
these smallest of blood vessels in the brain are lined with cells joined by tight junctions and so fluids do not seep in or leak out to the same degree as they do in other capillaries this creates the blood–brain barrier
pericytes play a major role in the formation of the tight junctions the barrier is less permeable to larger molecules but is still permeable to water carbon dioxide oxygen and most fat soluble substances (including anaesthetics and alcohol)
the blood brain barrier is not present in the circumventricular organs—which are structures in the brain that may need to respond to changes in body fluids—such as the pineal gland area postrema and some areas of the hypothalamus
there is a similar blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier which serves the same purpose as the blood–brain barrier but facilitates the transport of different substances into the brain due to the distinct structural characteristics between the two barrier systems developmentneurulation and neural crest cells primary and secondary vesicle stages of development in the early embryo to the fifth week brain of a human embryo in the sixth week of development at the beginning of the third week of development the embryonic ectoderm forms a thickened strip called the neural plate by the fourth week of development the neural plate has widened to give a broad cephalic end a less broad middle part and a narrow caudal end
these swellings are known as the primary brain vesicles and represent the beginnings of the forebrain (prosencephalon) midbrain (mesencephalon) and hindbrain (rhombencephalon)
neural crest cells (derived from the ectoderm) populate the lateral edges of the plate at the neural folds
in the fourth week—during the neurulation stage—the neural folds close to form the neural tube bringing together the neural crest cells at the neural crest
the neural crest runs the length of the tube with cranial neural crest cells at the cephalic end and caudal neural crest cells at the tail
cells detach from the crest and migrate in a craniocaudal (head to tail) wave inside the tube
cells at the cephalic end give rise to the brain and cells at the caudal end give rise to the spinal cord
the tube flexes as it grows forming the crescent shaped cerebral hemispheres at the head
the cerebral hemispheres first appear on day 32
early in the fourth week the cephalic part bends sharply forward in a cephalic flexure
this flexed part becomes the forebrain (prosencephalon) the adjoining curving part becomes the midbrain (mesencephalon) and the part caudal to the flexure becomes the hindbrain (rhombencephalon)
these areas are formed as swellings known as the three primary brain vesicles
in the fifth week of development five secondary brain vesicles have formed the forebrain separates into two vesicles – an anterior telencephalon and a posterior diencephalon
the telencephalon gives rise to the cerebral cortex basal ganglia and related structures
the diencephalon gives rise to the thalamus and hypothalamus
the hindbrain also splits into two areas – the metencephalon and the myelencephalon
the metencephalon gives rise to the cerebellum and pons
the myelencephalon gives rise to the medulla oblongata
also during the fifth week the brain divides into repeating segments called neuromeres
in the hindbrain these are known as rhombomeres a characteristic of the brain is the cortical folding known as gyrification
for just over five months of prenatal development the cortex is smooth
by the gestational age of 24 weeks the wrinkled morphology showing the fissures that begin to mark out the lobes of the brain is evident why the cortex wrinkles and folds is not well understood but gyrification has been linked to intelligence and neurological disorders and a number of gyrification theories have been proposed these theories include those based on mechanical buckling axonal tension and differential tangential expansion what is clear is that gyrification is not a random process but rather a complex developmentally predetermined process which generates patterns of folds that are consistent between individuals and most species the first groove to appear in the fourth month is the lateral cerebral fossa
the expanding caudal end of the hemisphere has to curve over in a forward direction to fit into the restricted space
this covers the fossa and turns it into a much deeper ridge known as the lateral sulcus and this marks out the temporal lobe
by the sixth month other sulci have formed that demarcate the frontal parietal and occipital lobes
a gene present in the human genome (arhgap11b) may play a major role in gyrification and encephalisation brain of human embryo at 4 5 weeks showing interior of forebrain brain interior at 5 weeks brain viewed at midline at 3 months functionmotor and sensory regions of the brain motor controlthe frontal lobe is involved in reasoning motor control emotion and language
it contains the motor cortex which is involved in planning and coordinating movement the prefrontal cortex which is responsible for higher level cognitive functioning and broca’s area which is essential for language production the motor system of the brain is responsible for the generation and control of movement
generated movements pass from the brain through nerves to motor neurons in the body which control the action of muscles
the corticospinal tract carries movements from the brain through the spinal cord to the torso and limbs
the cranial nerves carry movements related to the eyes mouth and face
gross movement – such as locomotion and the movement of arms and legs – is generated in the motor cortex divided into three parts the primary motor cortex found in the precentral gyrus and has sections dedicated to the movement of different body parts
these movements are supported and regulated by two other areas lying anterior to the primary motor cortex the premotor area and the supplementary motor area
the hands and mouth have a much larger area dedicated to them than other body parts allowing finer movement this has been visualised in a motor homunculus
impulses generated from the motor cortex travel along the corticospinal tract along the front of the medulla and cross over (decussate) at the medullary pyramids
these then travel down the spinal cord with most connecting to interneurons in turn connecting to lower motor neurons within the grey matter that then transmit the impulse to move to muscles themselves
the cerebellum and basal ganglia play a role in fine complex and coordinated muscle movements
connections between the cortex and the basal ganglia control muscle tone posture and movement initiation and are referred to as the extrapyramidal system
sensorycortical areas routing of neural signals from the two eyes to the brain the sensory nervous system is involved with the reception and processing of sensory information
this information is received through the cranial nerves through tracts in the spinal cord and directly at centres of the brain exposed to the blood the brain also receives and interprets information from the special senses of vision smell hearing and taste
mixed motor and sensory signals are also integrated from the skin the brain receives information about fine touch pressure pain vibration and temperature
from the joints the brain receives information about joint position
the sensory cortex is found just near the motor cortex and like the motor cortex has areas related to sensation from different body parts
sensation collected by a sensory receptor on the skin is changed to a nerve signal that is passed up a series of neurons through tracts in the spinal cord
the dorsal column–medial lemniscus pathway contains information about fine touch vibration and position of joints
the pathway fibres travel up the back part of the spinal cord to the back part of the medulla where they connect with second order neurons that immediately send fibres across the midline
these fibres then travel upwards into the ventrobasal complex in the thalamus where they connect with third order neurons which send fibres up to the sensory cortex
the spinothalamic tract carries information about pain temperature and gross touch
the pathway fibres travel up the spinal cord and connect with second order neurons in the reticular formation of the brainstem for pain and temperature and also terminate at the ventrobasal complex of the thalamus for gross touch
vision is generated by light that hits the retina of the eye
photoreceptors in the retina transduce the sensory stimulus of light into an electrical nerve signal that is sent to the visual cortex in the occipital lobe
visual signals leave the retinas through the optic nerves
optic nerve fibres from the retinas' nasal halves cross to the opposite sides joining the fibres from the temporal halves of the opposite retinas to form the optic tracts
the arrangements of the eyes' optics and the visual pathways mean vision from the left visual field is received by the right half of each retina is processed by the right visual cortex and vice versa
the optic tract fibres reach the brain at the lateral geniculate nucleus and travel through the optic radiation to reach the visual cortex
hearing and balance are both generated in the inner ear
sound results in vibrations of the ossicles which continue finally to the hearing organ and change in balance results in movement of liquids within the inner ear
this creates a nerve signal that passes through the vestibulocochlear nerve
from here it passes through to the cochlear nuclei the superior olivary nucleus the medial geniculate nucleus and finally the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex
the sense of smell is generated by receptor cells in the epithelium of the olfactory mucosa in the nasal cavity
this information passes via the olfactory nerve which goes into the skull through a relatively permeable part
this nerve transmits to the neural circuitry of the olfactory bulb from where information is passed to the olfactory cortex
taste is generated from receptors on the tongue and passed along the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves into the solitary nucleus in the brainstem
some taste information is also passed from the pharynx into this area via the vagus nerve
information is then passed from here through the thalamus into the gustatory cortex
regulationautonomic functions of the brain include the regulation or rhythmic control of the heart rate and rate of breathing and maintaining homeostasis
blood pressure and heart rate are influenced by the vasomotor centre of the medulla which causes arteries and veins to be somewhat constricted at rest
it does this by influencing the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems via the vagus nerve
information about blood pressure is generated by baroreceptors in aortic bodies in the aortic arch and passed to the brain along the afferent fibres of the vagus nerve
information about the pressure changes in the carotid sinus comes from carotid bodies located near the carotid artery and this is passed via a nerve joining with the glossopharyngeal nerve
this information travels up to the solitary nucleus in the medulla
signals from here influence the vasomotor centre to adjust vein and artery constriction accordingly
the brain controls the rate of breathing mainly by respiratory centres in the medulla and pons
the respiratory centres control respiration by generating motor signals that are passed down the spinal cord along the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm and other muscles of respiration
this is a mixed nerve that carries sensory information back to the centres
there are four respiratory centres three with a more clearly defined function and an apneustic centre with a less clear function
in the medulla a dorsal respiratory group causes the desire to breathe in and receives sensory information directly from the body
also in the medulla the ventral respiratory group influences breathing out during exertion
in the pons the pneumotaxic centre influences the duration of each breath and the apneustic centre seems to have an influence on inhalation
the respiratory centres directly senses blood carbon dioxide and ph
information about blood oxygen carbon dioxide and ph levels are also sensed on the walls of arteries in the peripheral chemoreceptors of the aortic and carotid bodies
this information is passed via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves to the respiratory centres
high carbon dioxide an acidic ph or low oxygen stimulate the respiratory centres
the desire to breathe in is also affected by pulmonary stretch receptors in the lungs which when activated prevent the lungs from overinflating by transmitting information to the respiratory centres via the vagus nerve
the hypothalamus in the diencephalon is involved in regulating many functions of the body
functions include neuroendocrine regulation regulation of the circadian rhythm control of the autonomic nervous system and the regulation of fluid and food intake
the circadian rhythm is controlled by two main cell groups in the hypothalamus
the anterior hypothalamus includes the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus which through gene expression cycles generates a roughly 24 hour circadian clock
in the circadian day an ultradian rhythm takes control of the sleeping pattern
sleep is an essential requirement for the body and brain and allows the closing down and resting of the body's systems
there are also findings that suggest that the daily build up of toxins in the brain are removed during sleep whilst awake the brain consumes a fifth of the body's total energy needs
sleep necessarily reduces this use and gives time for the restoration of energy giving atp
the effects of sleep deprivation show the absolute need for sleep
the lateral hypothalamus contains orexinergic neurons that control appetite and arousal through their projections to the ascending reticular activating system the hypothalamus controls the pituitary gland through the release of peptides such as oxytocin and vasopressin as well as dopamine into the median eminence
through the autonomic projections the hypothalamus is involved in regulating functions such as blood pressure heart rate breathing sweating and other homeostatic mechanisms
the hypothalamus also plays a role in thermal regulation and when stimulated by the immune system is capable of generating a fever
the hypothalamus is influenced by the kidneys when blood pressure falls the renin released by the kidneys stimulates a need to drink
the hypothalamus also regulates food intake through autonomic signals and hormone release by the digestive system
languagewhile language functions were traditionally thought to be localized to wernicke's area and broca's area it is now mostly accepted that a wider network of cortical regions contributes to language functions the study on how language is represented processed and acquired by the brain is called neurolinguistics which is a large multidisciplinary field drawing from cognitive neuroscience cognitive linguistics and psycholinguistics lateralisationthe cerebrum has a contralateral organisation with each hemisphere of the brain interacting primarily with one half of the body the left side of the brain interacts with the right side of the body and vice versa
the developmental cause for this is uncertain motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain both cross sides in the brainstem
visual input follows a more complex rule the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other the result is that connections from the left half of the retina in both eyes go to the left side of the brain whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field the functional consequence is that visual input from the left side of the world goes to the right side of the brain and vice versa thus the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body and visual input from the left side of the visual field the left and right sides of the brain appear symmetrical but they function asymmetrically for example the counterpart of the left hemisphere motor area controlling the right hand is the right hemisphere area controlling the left hand
there are however several important exceptions involving language and spatial cognition
the left frontal lobe is dominant for language
if a key language area in the left hemisphere is damaged it can leave the victim unable to speak or understand whereas equivalent damage to the right hemisphere would cause only minor impairment to language skills
"a substantial part of current understanding of the interactions between the two hemispheres has come from the study of ""split brain patients""—people who underwent surgical transection of the corpus callosum in an attempt to reduce the severity of epileptic seizures these patients do not show unusual behaviour that is immediately obvious but in some cases can behave almost like two different people in the same body with the right hand taking an action and then the left hand undoing it these patients when briefly shown a picture on the right side of the point of visual fixation are able to describe it verbally but when the picture is shown on the left are unable to describe it but may be able to give an indication with the left hand of the nature of the object shown emotionemotions are generally defined as two step multicomponent processes involving elicitation followed by psychological feelings appraisal expression autonomic responses and action tendencies attempts to localize basic emotions to certain brain regions have been controversial some research found no evidence for specific locations corresponding to emotions but instead found circuitry involved in general emotional processes"
the amygdala orbitofrontal cortex mid and anterior insula cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex appeared to be involved in generating the emotions while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience others however have found evidence of activation of specific regions such as the basal ganglia in happiness the subcallosal cingulate cortex in sadness and amygdala in fear cognitionthe brain is responsible for cognition which functions through numerous processes and executive functions executive functions include the ability to filter information and tune out irrelevant stimuli with attentional control and cognitive inhibition the ability to process and manipulate information held in working memory the ability to think about multiple concepts simultaneously and switch tasks with cognitive flexibility the ability to inhibit impulses and prepotent responses with inhibitory control and the ability to determine the relevance of information or appropriateness of an action higher order executive functions require the simultaneous use of multiple basic executive functions and include planning prospection and fluid intelligence (i e reasoning and problem solving) the prefrontal cortex plays a significant role in mediating executive functions planning involves activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlpfc) anterior cingulate cortex angular prefrontal cortex right prefrontal cortex and supramarginal gyrus working memory manipulation involves the dlpfc inferior frontal gyrus and areas of the parietal cortex inhibitory control involves multiple areas of the prefrontal cortex as well as the caudate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus physiologyneurotransmissionbrain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets
a neuron consists of a cell body axon and dendrites
dendrites are often extensive branches that receive information in the form of signals from the axon terminals of other neurons
the signals received may cause the neuron to initiate an action potential (an electrochemical signal or nerve impulse) which is sent along its axon to the axon terminal to connect with the dendrites or with the cell body of another neuron
an action potential is initiated at the initial segment of an axon which contains a specialised complex of proteins when an action potential reaches the axon terminal it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter at a synapse that propagates a signal that acts on the target cell
these chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine serotonin gaba glutamate and acetylcholine gaba is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter neurons link at synapses to form neural pathways neural circuits and large elaborate network systems such as the salience network and the default mode network and the activity between them is driven by the process of neurotransmission
metabolismpet image of the human brain showing energy consumption the brain consumes up to 20% of the energy used by the human body more than any other organ in humans blood glucose is the primary source of energy for most cells and is critical for normal function in a number of tissues including the brain the human brain consumes approximately 60% of blood glucose in fasted sedentary individuals brain metabolism normally relies upon blood glucose as an energy source but during times of low glucose (such as fasting endurance exercise or limited carbohydrate intake) the brain uses ketone bodies for fuel with a smaller need for glucose
the brain can also utilize lactate during exercise the brain stores glucose in the form of glycogen albeit in significantly smaller amounts than that found in the liver or skeletal muscle long chain fatty acids cannot cross the blood–brain barrier but the liver can break these down to produce ketone bodies
however short chain fatty acids (e g butyric acid propionic acid and acetic acid) and the medium chain fatty acids octanoic acid and heptanoic acid can cross the blood–brain barrier and be metabolised by brain cells although the human brain represents only 2% of the body weight it receives 15% of the cardiac output 20% of total body oxygen consumption and 25% of total body glucose utilization the brain mostly uses glucose for energy and deprivation of glucose as can happen in hypoglycemia can result in loss of consciousness the energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time but active regions of the cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions which forms the basis for the functional neuroimaging methods of pet and fmri these techniques provide a three dimensional image of metabolic activity a preliminary study showed that brain metabolic requirements in humans peak at about five years old the function of sleep is not fully understood however there is evidence that sleep enhances the clearance of metabolic waste products some of which are potentially neurotoxic from the brain and may also permit repair evidence suggests that the increased clearance of metabolic waste during sleep occurs via increased functioning of the glymphatic system sleep may also have an effect on cognitive function by weakening unnecessary connections researchthe brain is not fully understood and research is ongoing neuroscientists along with researchers from allied disciplines study how the human brain works
the boundaries between the specialties of neuroscience neurology and other disciplines such as psychiatry have faded as they are all influenced by basic research in neuroscience
neuroscience research has expanded considerably
"the ""decade of the brain"" an initiative of the united states government in the 1990s is considered to have marked much of this increase in research and was followed in 2013 by the brain initiative the human connectome project was a five year study launched in 2009 to analyse the anatomical and functional connections of parts of the brain and has provided much data an emerging phase in research may be that of simulating brain activity methodsinformation about the structure and function of the human brain comes from a variety of experimental methods including animals and humans"
information about brain trauma and stroke has provided information about the function of parts of the brain and the effects of brain damage
neuroimaging is used to visualise the brain and record brain activity
electrophysiology is used to measure record and monitor the electrical activity of the cortex
measurements may be of local field potentials of cortical areas or of the activity of a single neuron
an electroencephalogram can record the electrical activity of the cortex using electrodes placed non invasively on the scalp invasive measures include electrocorticography which uses electrodes placed directly on the exposed surface of the brain
this method is used in cortical stimulation mapping used in the study of the relationship between cortical areas and their systemic function by using much smaller microelectrodes single unit recordings can be made from a single neuron that give a high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution
this has enabled the linking of brain activity to behaviour and the creation of neuronal maps the development of cerebral organoids has opened ways for studying the growth of the brain and of the cortex and for understanding disease development offering further implications for therapeutic applications imagingfunctional neuroimaging techniques show changes in brain activity that relate to the function of specific brain areas
one technique is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) which has the advantages over earlier methods of spect and pet of not needing the use of radioactive materials and of offering a higher resolution another technique is functional near infrared spectroscopy
these methods rely on the haemodynamic response that shows changes in brain activity in relation to changes in blood flow useful in mapping functions to brain areas resting state fmri looks at the interaction of brain regions whilst the brain is not performing a specific task this is also used to show the default mode network
any electrical current generates a magnetic field neural oscillations induce weak magnetic fields and in functional magnetoencephalography the current produced can show localised brain function in high resolution
tractography uses mri and image analysis to create 3d images of the nerve tracts of the brain
connectograms give a graphical representation of the neural connections of the brain differences in brain structure can be measured in some disorders notably schizophrenia and dementia
different biological approaches using imaging have given more insight for example into the disorders of depression and obsessive compulsive disorder
a key source of information about the function of brain regions is the effects of damage to them advances in neuroimaging have enabled objective insights into mental disorders leading to faster diagnosis more accurate prognosis and better monitoring gene and protein expressionbioinformatics is a field of study that includes the creation and advancement of databases and computational and statistical techniques that can be used in studies of the human brain particularly in the areas of gene and protein expression
bioinformatics and studies in genomics and functional genomics generated the need for dna annotation a transcriptome technology identifying genes their locations and functions genecards is a major database
as of 2017 just under 20 00 protein coding genes are seen to be expressed in the human and some 400 of these genes are brain specific the data that has been provided on gene expression in the brain has fuelled further research into a number of disorders
the long term use of alcohol for example has shown altered gene expression in the brain and cell type specific changes that may relate to alcohol use disorder these changes have been noted in the synaptic transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex and are seen as a factor causing the drive to alcohol dependence and also to other substance abuses other related studies have also shown evidence of synaptic alterations and their loss in the ageing brain
changes in gene expression alter the levels of proteins in various neural pathways and this has been shown to be evident in synaptic contact dysfunction or loss
this dysfunction has been seen to affect many structures of the brain and has a marked effect on inhibitory neurons resulting in a decreased level of neurotransmission and subsequent cognitive decline and disease clinical significanceinjuryinjury to the brain can manifest in many ways
traumatic brain injury for example received in contact sport after a fall or a traffic or work accident can be associated with both immediate and longer term problems
immediate problems may include bleeding within the brain this may compress the brain tissue or damage its blood supply
bruising to the brain may occur
bruising may cause widespread damage to the nerve tracts that can lead to a condition of diffuse axonal injury a fractured skull injury to a particular area deafness and concussion are also possible immediate developments
in addition to the site of injury the opposite side of the brain may be affected termed a contrecoup injury
longer term issues that may develop include posttraumatic stress disorder and hydrocephalus
chronic traumatic encephalopathy can develop following multiple head injuries diseaseneurodegenerative diseases result in progressive damage to different parts of the brain's function and worsen with age
common examples include dementia such as alzheimer's disease alcoholic dementia or vascular dementia parkinson's disease and other rarer infectious genetic or metabolic causes such as huntington's disease motor neuron diseases hiv dementia syphilis related dementia and wilson's disease
neurodegenerative diseases can affect different parts of the brain and can affect movement memory and cognition
cerebral atherosclerosis is atherosclerosis that affects the brain
it results from the build up of plaques formed of cholesterol in the large arteries of the brain and can be mild to significant
when significant arteries can become narrowed enough to reduce blood flow
it contributes to the development of dementia and has protein similarities to those found in alzheimer’s disease the brain although protected by the blood–brain barrier can be affected by infections including viruses bacteria and fungi
infection may be of the meninges (meningitis) the brain matter (encephalitis) or within the brain matter (such as a cerebral abscess)
rare prion diseases including creutzfeldt–jakob disease and its variant and kuru may also affect the brain
tumoursbrain tumours can be either benign or cancerous
most malignant tumours arise from another part of the body most commonly from the lung breast and skin
cancers of brain tissue can also occur and originate from any tissue in and around the brain
meningioma cancer of the meninges around the brain is more common than cancers of brain tissue
cancers within the brain may cause symptoms related to their size or position with symptoms including headache and nausea or the gradual development of focal symptoms such as gradual difficulty seeing swallowing talking or as a change of mood
cancers are in general investigated through the use of ct scans and mri scans
a variety of other tests including blood tests and lumbar puncture may be used to investigate for the cause of the cancer and evaluate the type and stage of the cancer
the corticosteroid dexamethasone is often given to decrease the swelling of brain tissue around a tumour
surgery may be considered however given the complex nature of many tumours or based on tumour stage or type radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be considered more suitable
mental disordersmental disorders such as depression schizophrenia bipolar disorder posttraumatic stress disorder attention deficit hyperactivity disorder obsessive compulsive disorder tourette syndrome and addiction are known to relate to the functioning of the brain treatment for mental disorders may include psychotherapy psychiatry social intervention and personal recovery work or cognitive behavioural therapy the underlying issues and associated prognoses vary significantly between individuals epilepsyepileptic seizures are thought to relate to abnormal electrical activity
seizure activity can manifest as absence of consciousness focal effects such as limb movement or impediments of speech or be generalized in nature
status epilepticus refers to a seizure or series of seizures that have not terminated within 5 minutes seizures have a large number of causes however many seizures occur without a definitive cause being found
in a person with epilepsy risk factors for further seizures may include sleeplessness drug and alcohol intake and stress
seizures may be assessed using blood tests eeg and various medical imaging techniques based on the medical history and medical examination findings
in addition to treating an underlying cause and reducing exposure to risk factors anticonvulsant medications can play a role in preventing further seizures
congenitalsome brain disorders such as tay–sachs disease are congenital and linked to genetic and chromosomal mutations a rare group of congenital cephalic disorders known as lissencephaly is characterised by the lack of or inadequacy of cortical folding normal development of the brain can be affected during pregnancy by nutritional deficiencies teratogens infectious diseases and by the use of recreational drugs including alcohol (which may result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders) most cerebral arteriovenous malformations are congenital these tangled networks of blood vessels may remain without symptoms but at their worst may rupture and cause intracranial hemorrhaging strokea stroke is a decrease in blood supply to an area of the brain causing cell death and brain injury
"this can lead to a wide range of symptoms including the ""fast"" symptoms of facial droop arm weakness and speech difficulties (including with speaking and finding words or forming sentences) symptoms relate to the function of the affected area of the brain and can point to the likely site and cause of the stroke"
difficulties with movement speech or sight usually relate to the cerebrum whereas imbalance double vision vertigo and symptoms affecting more than one side of the body usually relate to the brainstem or cerebellum
most strokes result from loss of blood supply typically because of an embolus rupture of a fatty plaque causing thrombus or narrowing of small arteries
strokes can also result from bleeding within the brain
transient ischaemic attacks (tias) are strokes in which symptoms resolve within 24 hours
investigation into the stroke will involve a medical examination (including a neurological examination) and the taking of a medical history focusing on the duration of the symptoms and risk factors (including high blood pressure atrial fibrillation and smoking)
further investigation is needed in younger patients
an ecg and biotelemetry may be conducted to identify atrial fibrillation an ultrasound can investigate narrowing of the carotid arteries an echocardiogram can be used to look for clots within the heart diseases of the heart valves or the presence of a patent foramen ovale
blood tests are routinely done as part of the workup including diabetes tests and a lipid profile
some treatments for stroke are time critical
these include clot dissolution or surgical removal of a clot for ischaemic strokes and decompression for haemorrhagic strokes as stroke is time critical hospitals and even pre hospital care of stroke involves expedited investigations – usually a ct scan to investigate for a haemorrhagic stroke and a ct or mr angiogram to evaluate arteries that supply the brain
mri scans not as widely available may be able to demonstrate the affected area of the brain more accurately particularly with ischaemic stroke
having experienced a stroke a person may be admitted to a stroke unit and treatments may be directed as preventing future strokes including ongoing anticoagulation (such as aspirin or clopidogrel) antihypertensives and lipid lowering drugs
a multidisciplinary team including speech pathologists physiotherapists occupational therapists and psychologists plays a large role in supporting a person affected by a stroke and their rehabilitation a history of stroke increases the risk of developing dementia by around 70% and recent stroke increases the risk by around 120% brain deathbrain death refers to an irreversible total loss of brain function this is characterised by coma loss of reflexes and apnoea however the declaration of brain death varies geographically and is not always accepted in some countries there is also a defined syndrome of brainstem death declaration of brain death can have profound implications as the declaration under the principle of medical futility will be associated with the withdrawal of life support and as those with brain death often have organs suitable for organ donation the process is often made more difficult by poor communication with patients' families when brain death is suspected reversible differential diagnoses such as electrolyte neurological and drug related cognitive suppression need to be excluded testing for reflexes[b] can be of help in the decision as can the absence of response and breathing
clinical observations including a total lack of responsiveness a known diagnosis and neural imaging evidence may all play a role in the decision to pronounce brain death society and cultureneuroanthropology is the study of the relationship between culture and the brain
it explores how the brain gives rise to culture and how culture influences brain development cultural differences and their relation to brain development and structure are researched in different fields the mindthe skull of phineas gage with the path of the iron rod that passed through it without killing him but altering his cognition
the case helped to convince people that mental functions were localized in the brain
the philosophy of the mind studies such issues as the problem of understanding consciousness and the mind–body problem
the relationship between the brain and the mind is a significant challenge both philosophically and scientifically
this is because of the difficulty in explaining how mental activities such as thoughts and emotions can be implemented by physical structures such as neurons and synapses or by any other type of physical mechanism
this difficulty was expressed by gottfried leibniz in the analogy known as leibniz's mill one is obliged to admit that perception and what depends upon it is inexplicable on mechanical principles that is by figures and motions
in imagining that there is a machine whose construction would enable it to think to sense and to have perception one could conceive it enlarged while retaining the same proportions so that one could enter into it just like into a windmill
supposing this one should when visiting within it find only parts pushing one another and never anything by which to explain a perception
— leibniz monadologydoubt about the possibility of a mechanistic explanation of thought drove rené descartes and most other philosophers along with him to dualism the belief that the mind is to some degree independent of the brain there has always however been a strong argument in the opposite direction
there is clear empirical evidence that physical manipulations of or injuries to the brain (for example by drugs or by lesions respectively) can affect the mind in potent and intimate ways in the 19th century the case of phineas gage a railway worker who was injured by a stout iron rod passing through his brain convinced both researchers and the public that cognitive functions were localised in the brain following this line of thinking a large body of empirical evidence for a close relationship between brain activity and mental activity has led most neuroscientists and contemporary philosophers to be materialists believing that mental phenomena are ultimately the result of or reducible to physical phenomena brain sizethe size of the brain and a person's intelligence are not strongly related studies tend to indicate small to moderate correlations (averaging around 0 3 to 0 4) between brain volume and iq the most consistent associations are observed within the frontal temporal and parietal lobes the hippocampi and the cerebellum but these only account for a relatively small amount of variance in iq which itself has only a partial relationship to general intelligence and real world performance other animals including whales and elephants have larger brains than humans
however when the brain to body mass ratio is taken into account the human brain is almost twice as large as that of a bottlenose dolphin and three times as large as that of a chimpanzee
however a high ratio does not of itself demonstrate intelligence very small animals have high ratios and the treeshrew has the largest quotient of any mammal in popular culturephrenology summarized in an 1883 chart earlier ideas about the relative importance of the different organs of the human body sometimes emphasized the heart modern western popular conceptions in contrast have placed increasing focus on the brain research has disproved some common misconceptions about the brain
these include both ancient and modern myths
it is not true (for example) that neurons are not replaced after the age of two nor that normal humans use only ten per cent of the brain popular culture has also oversimplified the lateralisation of the brain by suggesting that functions are completely specific to one side of the brain or the other
"akio mori coined the term ""game brain"" for the unreliably supported theory that spending long periods playing video games harmed the brain's pre frontal region and impaired the expression of emotion and creativity historically particularly in the early 19th century the brain featured in popular culture through phrenology a pseudoscience that assigned personality attributes to different regions of the cortex"
the cortex remains important in popular culture as covered in books and satire the human brain can feature in science fiction with themes such as brain transplants and cyborgs (beings with features like partly artificial brains) the 1942 science fiction book (adapted three times for the cinema) donovan's brain tells the tale of an isolated brain kept alive in vitro gradually taking over the personality of the book's protagonist historyearly historythe edwin smith papyrus an ancient egyptian medical treatise written in the 17th century bc contains the earliest recorded reference to the brain
the hieroglyph for brain occurring eight times in this papyrus describes the symptoms diagnosis and prognosis of two traumatic injuries to the head
the papyrus mentions the external surface of the brain the effects of injury (including seizures and aphasia) the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid in the fifth century bc alcmaeon of croton in magna grecia first considered the brain to be the seat of the mind also in the fifth century bc in athens the unknown author of on the sacred disease a medical treatise which is part of the hippocratic corpus and traditionally attributed to hippocrates believed the brain to be the seat of intelligence
aristotle in his biology initially believed the heart to be the seat of intelligence and saw the brain as a cooling mechanism for the blood
he reasoned that humans are more rational than the beasts because among other reasons they have a larger brain to cool their hot bloodedness aristotle did describe the meninges and distinguished between the cerebrum and cerebellum herophilus of chalcedon in the fourth and third centuries bc distinguished the cerebrum and the cerebellum and provided the first clear description of the ventricles and with erasistratus of ceos experimented on living brains
their works are now mostly lost and we know about their achievements due mostly to secondary sources
some of their discoveries had to be re discovered a millennium after their deaths anatomist physician galen in the second century ad during the time of the roman empire dissected the brains of sheep monkeys dogs and pigs
he concluded that as the cerebellum was denser than the brain it must control the muscles while as the cerebrum was soft it must be where the senses were processed
galen further theorized that the brain functioned by movement of animal spirits through the ventricles renaissancein 1316 mondino de luzzi's anathomia began the modern study of brain anatomy niccolò massa discovered in 1536 that the ventricles were filled with fluid archangelo piccolomini of rome was the first to distinguish between the cerebrum and cerebral cortex in 1543 andreas vesalius published his seven volume de humani corporis fabrica the seventh book covered the brain and eye with detailed images of the ventricles cranial nerves pituitary gland meninges structures of the eye the vascular supply to the brain and spinal cord and an image of the peripheral nerves vesalius rejected the common belief that the ventricles were responsible for brain function arguing that many animals have a similar ventricular system to humans but no true intelligence rené descartes proposed the theory of dualism to tackle the issue of the brain's relation to the mind
he suggested that the pineal gland was where the mind interacted with the body serving as the seat of the soul and as the connection through which animal spirits passed from the blood into the brain this dualism likely provided impetus for later anatomists to further explore the relationship between the anatomical and functional aspects of brain anatomy thomas willis is considered a second pioneer in the study of neurology and brain science
he wrote cerebri anatome (latin anatomy of the brain)[c] in 1664 followed by cerebral pathology in 1667
"in these he described the structure of the cerebellum the ventricles the cerebral hemispheres the brainstem and the cranial nerves studied its blood supply and proposed functions associated with different areas of the brain the circle of willis was named after his investigations into the blood supply of the brain and he was the first to use the word ""neurology"
"""willis removed the brain from the body when examining it and rejected the commonly held view that the cortex only consisted of blood vessels and the view of the last two millennia that the cortex was only incidentally important in the middle of 19th century emil du bois reymond and hermann von helmholtz were able to use a galvanometer to show that electrical impulses passed at measurable speeds along nerves refuting the view of their teacher johannes peter müller that the nerve impulse was a vital function that could not be measured richard caton in 1875 demonstrated electrical impulses in the cerebral hemispheres of rabbits and monkeys in the 1820s jean pierre flourens pioneered the experimental method of damaging specific parts of animal brains describing the effects on movement and behavior modern perioddrawing by camillo golgi of vertical section of rabbit hippocampus from his ""sulla fina anatomia degli organi centrali del sistema nervoso"" 1885 studies of the brain became more sophisticated with the use of the microscope and the development of a silver staining method by camillo golgi during the 1880s"
this was able to show the intricate structures of single neurons this was used by santiago ramón y cajal and led to the formation of the neuron doctrine the then revolutionary hypothesis that the neuron is the functional unit of the brain
he used microscopy to uncover many cell types and proposed functions for the cells he saw for this golgi and cajal are considered the founders of twentieth century neuroscience both sharing the nobel prize in 1906 for their studies and discoveries in this field charles sherrington published his influential 1906 work the integrative action of the nervous system examining the function of reflexes evolutionary development of the nervous system functional specialisation of the brain and layout and cellular function of the central nervous system in 1942 he coined the term enchanted loom as a metaphor for the brain
john farquhar fulton founded the journal of neurophysiology and published the first comprehensive textbook on the physiology of the nervous system during 1938 neuroscience during the twentieth century began to be recognised as a distinct unified academic discipline with david rioch francis o schmitt and stephen kuffler playing critical roles in establishing the field rioch originated the integration of basic anatomical and physiological research with clinical psychiatry at the walter reed army institute of research starting in the 1950s during the same period schmitt established the neuroscience research program an inter university and international organisation bringing together biology medicine psychological and behavioural sciences
the word neuroscience itself arises from this program paul broca associated regions of the brain with specific functions in particular language in broca's area following work on brain damaged patients john hughlings jackson described the function of the motor cortex by watching the progression of epileptic seizures through the body
carl wernicke described a region associated with language comprehension and production
korbinian brodmann divided regions of the brain based on the appearance of cells by 1950 sherrington papez and maclean had identified many of the brainstem and limbic system functions the capacity of the brain to re organise and change with age and a recognised critical development period were attributed to neuroplasticity pioneered by margaret kennard who experimented on monkeys during the 1930 40s harvey cushing (1869–1939) is recognised as the first proficient brain surgeon in the world in 1937 walter dandy began the practice of vascular neurosurgery by performing the first surgical clipping of an intracranial aneurysm comparative anatomythe human brain has many properties that are common to all vertebrate brains many of its features are common to all mammalian brains most notably a six layered cerebral cortex and a set of associated structures including the hippocampus and amygdala the cortex is proportionally larger in humans than in many other mammals humans have more association cortex sensory and motor parts than smaller mammals such as the rat and the cat as a primate brain the human brain has a much larger cerebral cortex in proportion to body size than most mammals and a highly developed visual system as a hominid brain the human brain is substantially enlarged even in comparison to the brain of a typical monkey
the sequence of human evolution from australopithecus (four million years ago) to homo sapiens (modern humans) was marked by a steady increase in brain size as brain size increased this altered the size and shape of the skull from about 600 cm3 in homo habilis to an average of about 1520 cm3 in homo neanderthalensis differences in dna gene expression and gene–environment interactions help explain the differences between the function of the human brain and other primates
