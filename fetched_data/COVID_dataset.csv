"""coronavirus disease 2019 (covid 19) is a contagious disease caused by a virus the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars cov 2)"
the first known case was identified in wuhan china in december 2019
the disease quickly spread worldwide resulting in the covid 19 pandemic
the symptoms of covid‑19 are variable but often include fever cough headache fatigue breathing difficulties loss of smell and loss of taste
symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus
at least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms
of those who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classified as patients most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia) while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea hypoxia or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging) and 5% develop critical symptoms (respiratory failure shock or multiorgan dysfunction)
older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms
some people continue to experience a range of effects (long covid) for months after recovery and damage to organs has been observed
multi year studies are underway to further investigate the long term effects of the disease covid‑19 transmits when infectious particles are breathed in or come into contact with the eyes nose or mouth
the risk is highest when people are in close proximity but small airborne particles containing the virus can remain suspended in the air and travel over longer distances particularly indoors
transmission can also occur when people touch their eyes nose or mouth after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated by the virus
people remain contagious for up to 20 days and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms testing methods for covid 19 to detect the virus's nucleic acid include real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt‑pcr) transcription mediated amplification and reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (rt‑lamp) from a nasopharyngeal swab several covid 19 vaccines have been approved and distributed in various countries which have initiated mass vaccination campaigns
other preventive measures include physical or social distancing quarantining ventilation of indoor spaces use of face masks or coverings in public covering coughs and sneezes hand washing and keeping unwashed hands away from the face
while work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus the primary treatment is symptomatic
management involves the treatment of symptoms through supportive care isolation and experimental measures
"during the initial outbreak in wuhan the virus and disease were commonly referred to as """"coronavirus"""" and """"wuhan coronavirus"""" with the disease sometimes called """"wuhan pneumonia"""""
in the past many diseases have been named after geographical locations such as the spanish flu middle east respiratory syndrome and zika virus
in january 2020 the world health organization (who) recommended 2019 ncov and 2019 ncov acute respiratory disease as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations or groups of people in disease and virus names to prevent social stigma
"the official names covid‑19 and sars cov 2 were issued by the who on 11 february 2020 with covid 19 being shorthand for """"coronavirus disease 2019"""""
"the who additionally uses """"the covid‑19 virus"""" and """"the virus responsible for covid‑19"""" in public communications"
complications may include pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) multi organ failure septic shock and death
cardiovascular complications may include heart failure arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation) heart inflammation and thrombosis particularly venous thromboembolism
approximately 20–30% of people who present with covid‑19 have elevated liver enzymes reflecting liver injury
